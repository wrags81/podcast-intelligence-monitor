That''s my honest belief. And I believe it''s not just in Iowa, it''s across the country. But when I look around and see people that were running for office, it was all about policy. It''s all about here''s this tax rate or you know this regulation needs to be changed and I just thought no one is standing up to say we have to get the culture right first. We have to step in and say what does it mean to be an American? What does it mean to be an Ian? And are the traditions and the heritage and the value of our ancestors important to us? And that''s the in the deepest part of my heart what motivates me in something like this. I actually don''t want to be a politician. I bet I''ve not had interest in it. You know, I uh spent a lot of my life in the private sector and building schools and uh I have a I have a pretty good life. I have a great family and a wife who loves me and supports me. Uh but you know in um you know uh 1850 my family came over from Germany and great great grandpa built our farmhouse uh and we had that same house on this piece of land in Iowa until 2005 and my great-grandmother passed away and I can still remember my grandma called me and she said, "Zack, you wouldn''t want anything to this old farmhouse, would you?" And I had, you know, graduated from high school in Iowa. I was off in college and I said, "No, I''m I''m there''s something better out here. I''m I''m off to get something to find something better. And then uh a number of years later, I was driving by to see my other great-grandmother who lived to be 103. Um and I drove by the old farm and I just drove up. I said, "Hey, could I take a look around?" And they said, "Yeah." I said, "You know, my great great grandpa built this. He was a thirdass passenger on the SS Wand coming from Hamburg, Germany as a 14-year-old. He was in the stowage. That''s where he traveled over to America. and uh he became a carpenter and then earned enough money to buy the farm and build it with his uncle. And I said, "Hey, if you''re ever thinking about selling it, will you please let me know and it I just didn''t think anything coming that that time." But uh a couple years later, they called me and said, "Hey, we''re going to sell this farm. Would you want?" I''m like, "Yes." I don''t know how I''m going to do it, but uh I end up scraping together enough money to get an FHA loan, a down payment, and I bought the farm. And then since that time in 2014, I''ve been working to re rebuild it and restore it. And is the house still there? >> House is still there. You know, when I bought it, it was, you know, covered in vinyl. It it it had been completely changed on the outside. Um >> Yeah. 150 years is a long time. >> Yeah. And and being completely changed the outside. But I went to my my dad''s cousin Peter and he just kind of had the repository of great grandma''s photos. And so I got this pallet of boxes of photos and I spent I''m not I''m not kidding hundreds of hours going through photos and I was looking for every photo I could find of this old farmhouse. And I''ll tell you to anybody who wants to be radicalized on what we''ve lost as a culture, spend that much time going through your great-grandmother''s photos. >> Yeah. >> And you''ll realize the community, the traditions, the pride. I''ve done it. >> A lot of it''s gone. It''s unrecognizable. >> unrecognizable. And so I did that and uh I found every single picture I could find and I put the house back together board by board, counted every single piece of sighting, make sure it matched, and now we live in the home that was built by my great great-grandfather. Um, and I I tell people I didn''t do that so I could run for governor. I mean, the I started doing this over 10 years ago. I did it because I wanted my children to understand their story and that their heritage and their culture, what built them, the man who built this house, who I bet hoped someday my kids would live in it. Yes. But knew he would never meet them, that that story matters deeply. And so that''s what really got me into this. you know, uh, I was not looking to run for for this seat. And as I was talking to my wife about this, the current governor of Iowa, who by the way has done a very good job. I mean, we''re likely other than Florida, maybe the one of the most conservative states, and she''s done a great job at that. >> He''s a nice person. >> Yeah. Um, you know, when um we were looking at this, my wife said, you know, the seat hasn''t been open in 20 years. And there are issues in our state that are not dealing with taxes, that are not dealing with regulations, that are systemic, deep issues that are really causing our people to be hurt. And I talk about them all the time. And it was kind of from her this moment of hey, you know, put up or stop talking about it because this is an opportunity to go make real change. And so that''s why I''m running. So you said there are systemic issues that are not included in the normal pallet of politician concerns, which would be taxes and regulation. >> How just in order of importance, can you go through a few of them? Well, I think you know I I''ve spent my life uh in large part as an entrepreneur and uh in businesses organization I''ve run or started I have key metrics that I''m tracking to know the health of my my companies or the health of an organization you know I think I think on that list for a state is the physical climate of it that''s no doubt that''s part of it like can people afford to live here yes that''s a big part of course but the other there''s other deeper issues that I think are more long- term firm and focus that we, you know, because of this like constant news cycle of what''s happening right now that we all have to respond to, which thank god I''m not running for a federal office because it''s like never ending and always changing. But because of um because of that, often we''re distracted or our eyes are taken off the ball purposefully from the big issues. And a couple of them are this. Iowa''s number four in the nation for net out migration of our kids 25 to 29. >> Yeah. How can you build a state if your people are leaving? Important new people. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, we can talk about that. Um, another one would be, you know, 25% of our farmlands now owned by out of state investors and funds that don''t live in our state. So, our farmers who have had this ancestral connection to the land are now becoming tenants again. something we left Germany in large part for. You know, just take a side quest here for a second. I remember when I was doing a lot of that research in my family to understand a lot about the history and uh and what drove them to leave this homeland of theirs, you know, cuz I always made up, you know, 3540% German immigrants came over, very industrious people, very family oriented people, uh people that had pride in the work that they do. objectively some of the best people ever. I would I would say that >> I''m not one of them, but I just I I just have noticed. >> Oh, big on tradition and and um and big on family and uh a lot of pride in where they came from. So, what would motivate people to leave? And you know, I think the common answer we always heard was well, it''s religious persecution. And so, I started to get interested in this just to understand more what were the real conditions. And I actually found out that uh you know my family a lot of Germans came over around 1850. Well in 1848 in Germany there was an attempted revolution >> across across Europe. >> Across Europe. Yes. And it was called the 48ers. And what did they want? They well they wanted to be able to own the ground under their feet. They wanted free speech. They didn''t like slavery. They had a lot of these you know now what we call western ideals. >> It was the end of feudalism. Right. >> Yes. Right. And so what happened to them? They were defeated. And so in Germany when they''re defeated, many of them got exiled and then many others just left. Well, what state came online in 1846 was Iowa. And it was also very agrarian just like where they came from. And so many people came over. And I like to talk about this that you know uh one of the key points in Iowa''s history that I''m most proud of is how Ians responded during the Civil War. So, you know, uh we had the Missouri Compromise. We had the Kansas Nebraska Act. Um, and with that with that decision of, you know, they sort of get to decide whether or not they''re going to be free or slave, there was a lot of wealthy landowning elites that were rushing to the Midwest to try to lobby to create slave states, >> of course, >> and this Iowa >> plantations on the prairie, >> right? And Iowa was not a part of this, you know. Um, but one of my favorite stories in 1861, the governor of Iowa, his name was uh, Governor Samuel Kirkwood, he was on his plow in his field when a messenger from the Department of War brought a a message on horseback to him and in it the president said he needed to uh, put together a company of 750 troops to be ready in 2 weeks. And mind you, this is 15 years after Iowa became a state. I mean, we''re in our infancy. And he said, 750 troops in two weeks. How can that be done? And two weeks later, 10,000 Ians had signed up. By the end of the Civil War, more Ians fought in the Civil War than any other state per capita. Why was that? I believe and there''s some evidence of course I I read deeply in this that they had just left a country that they saw oppression in and they fled that left everything and they were saying this isn''t going to happen here and so I think when you talk about land and you talk about now 25% of our land is now owned by people that don''t live in our state they''re not contributing to our communities they don''t go to the football games they''re not shopping on Main Street it''s a real generational issue and I go to these auctions. I''ve bid against many of these people. >> Land auctions. >> Oh yeah. And very often it''s a farm management company. The actual owner. We don''t know who they are. We actually don''t know who owns our land in Iowa. There''s not human level disclosure that''s required. So you can own land in an LLC and that LLC could be wholly owned by a trust and all the state knows is that the LLC owns the land. That''s it. And so we''ve gotten to this place where just common courtesy or you know just common tradition of knowing who your neighbors are is not there anymore. >> Well, it''s impossible. >> Yeah. in in in can''t find their names, it''s kind of hard to have a community. It''s buried. America''s ranchers helped build this country. For over 250 years, ranchers fed America through droughts, wars, pandemics, every other kind of chaos. Our friends at Good Ranchers built their company on that honorable legacy. Good Ranchers is a meat company. It''s 100% committed to America. They raise every cut on local American soil. The entire packaging and fulfillment process takes place in this country. Same with customer support. No dark basement in India.

That''s code Tucker for an extra 25 bucks off the order on top of $500 you''ll save this year for subscribing. Goodranchers.com. American meat delivered. And so one of the things as governor that I want to do is require human level disclosure of land ownership because I would bet that that''s actually more than 25% of our lands. >> Of course it is owned by people. So then another two other ones by the way if you don''t you know have to bear the consequences of your actions then you''re much more likely to exploit and degrade the community that you''re taking money from. So, like, why wouldn''t you? I mean, why do you care about long-term best practices? You don''t. You''re just extracting wealth. This is the spiritual part of the discussion, I believe. You know, I I was my father was a 30-year conservationist and a pastor. And um I grew up like learning to love and appreciate the place. I I tell I''ve said this before, but you know, he legitimately made me believe that every sunset was made for me by God. Amen. we would we''d be driving and say, "Look at what God made for you." And I still think to those things to this day of just like those little pieces that made me appreciate creation. And one of my favorite clips from your show ever, ever is when you were on with uh Bobby Kennedy and he was having that discussion about how nature is how we connect deeply with God. >> Yeah, it makes me emotional thinking about it. I couldn''t agree more. I sent that to so many people and especially my father because it it''s true and it''s language we don''t use anymore. It brings you to a higher place and it helps you understand like >> this is much deeper than just who owns a piece of land or what''s happening. It''s it''s actually like we are connected to God through the land through his creation. It''s on every page of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. It''s there''s a lot of nature. >> It''s what''s what''s the Garden of Eden filled with? Trees, rivers, >> animals. Right. Okay. >> And all the parables that have to do with that. Of course. So, so that of course the that''s a systemic issue and let me say that that''s been going on for a long time and nobody''s really talked about it. You go to a cafe, every farmer is talking about these things about like, oh, you see the We had a piece of land in Northwest Iowa uh recently go for $32,000 an acre. Not development land. Okay. I''m interested I''m a land buyer. I''m interested in land. I''m interested, you know, and all that. How do you get to $32,000 an acre even for, you know, famously productive farmland? Like, what is that? What''s the potential return on that? How did that happen? >> Well, let''s just say commonly we''ll go to $20,000 an acre. That''s fairly common in Northwest Iowa. It''s some of the best land in the world. Bonkers. >> It is. It is. And so, you know, look, PE outside investors look at Iowa as as a great investment because it''s a solid asset. >> Yes. It''s a hedge against the dollar of course >> and you get a dividend like you rent out the land like and so one of the things I I kind of complain or real pine about a lot is that our land isn''t an asset class. It''s actually was meant as the inheritance for the sons and daughters of our state to build their lives, their communities, and their families. And when they''re tenants on that land and they''re paying high dollar rent, because the only way you can justify high a high uh price like that is very high rent. um you you''re stripping away a lot of go back to say it''s like kind of the spiritual aspect of this and that land is best when it''s owned and farmed by the same person. it. We know this. We know this from if you own rental properties or whatever it might be. Like there''s a connection of stewardship that comes with that to know that I''m passing this piece of ground on to my grandkids and their kids and their kids and that''s what it should be. But that that is being actively taken away in our state. And so two other things that I I think are big systemic issues that are on my scorecard as I''d say is one is our farmers are actively being exploited by big egg companies. When I was growing up uh born in Iowa, we had over 300 seed and input companies, you know, fertilizer and and agrochemical companies that were selling to our farmers. Today that number''s three that control 85% of the market. Over 90% of seed technology is owned by two companies. >> Monsanto >> actually it''s uh Bayer and Corteva own 90% of this of the uh which owns Monsanto now. Yeah. >> See technology. >> No I of course but I forgot that Monsanto doesn''t actually exist anymore. Does it? >> I don''t think so. >> They changed the name. Yeah. It was bought by Bear in Germany. >> Yeah. They''re they''re sure mentioned a lot in court still but yeah they''re not um they''re not a company. So if you look at the long-term trend that anytime there''s a rise in commodity prices, these input costs go up even though there''s not a direct correlating factor. You know, there''s a study out of the University of Illinois and this study compared the cost of farming in Brazil to the cost of farming in Illinois, Iowa basically. And you have to understand that the three big companies in America that provide these inputs are also the same three big companies of Brazil. Bayer, Corteva, and Sententa. That study said that for growing corn using the same application rate that they''re charging Brazilian farmers about $150 less per acre than they are Iowa farmers. How? Well, the real answer is because they''re an unchecked monopoly and competition doesn''t exist. There''s tacic collusion. But he here''s how it actually works. They they have what they call regionalbased pricing. But what it really is is this. When they look at uh their pricing, they base it on the yield that you''re going to create. So let''s say you have more productive land, even though you''re using the same amount of product, they''re going to take more. you have less productive land even though you use the same amount of product, they''re going to take more. It''s it''s wrong, you know, and I will I will give credit to Brooke Rollins and Donald Trump and the administration. They''re talking about bringing antirust and and investigating this with Department of Justice. And one of the things I pledged to do that if I''m governor of Iowa, I''m going to lead the charge to bring antitrust suits against these companies that are exploiting our farmers because they''re taking every dollar they possibly can. And we''re already on life support. I mean, many many most farms are operating at a loss right now. And when you talk to farmers about this, you do not and like I can''t emphasize this enough, you do not hear them talk about tariffs. They''re not. Matter of fact, the price of soybeans this year with the tariffs was higher than it was last year before the tariffs. The change came that the cost of growing went up. I mean, the cost of the input products that they''re that they''re using went up. And so I I tell people all the time, the tariffs are not the issue. We have to get this unchecked monopoly under in check and under control. >> Obviously inputs are essential uh to agriculture well to any creating anything. Um one of them is diesel fuel. Not a lot of movement there. But then you have the products that you just mentioned seeds and fertilizer. Taking out seeds. Let''s just focus on fertilizer. What are the products like? Well, um I mean it just depends on on the most common product, you know, for fertilizers in hydro ammonia. It''s uh used in the fall. It''s where a lot of lot of um the nitrogen comes from. But then you have other products uh that are, you know, uh you know, um products from Earth, you know, potassium, pot ash, uh those things. Uh but you look at the the trend of the pricing in these you know um I think it was five years ago in the past five years nitrogen fertilizers went up 150% and the price of corn''s down 2%. So farmers are they''re really being I would say extorted in this process. You obviously want to sleep well and fashionably Brooklyn bedding can help.

Tell you something I was really surprised by and I don''t know much about it, but I was hunting on a farm in November right before Thanksgiving, a big big big working farm. And I was with the ranch manager and um in a truck and he said, "This is the truck we used to spray Roundup." And I said, "People using Roundup? I don''t You know, I''m not in the egg business. I thought Roundup was bad. >> Yeah. >> Again, I''m I''m very ignorant, but I just thought I didn''t realize that people were still spraying Roundup. He said, "Oh, everyone sprays Roundup. Like, everybody does." And we kind of don''t talk about it. And I''m like, "Hm, I mean, is that I''m not attacking Roundup specifically, but like are we sure that these chemicals are all safe?" Well, you know, well, Roundup is the most uh high it''s the most highly used herbicide in the history of the country or history of the world. >> It''s so effective. I mean, I''ve seen >> it''s been it''s losing its effectiveness greatly. It now has Oh, yeah. It has to be Yeah. You''ll have um different mixtures now that''ll go in because they''re we''re getting Roundup resist glyphosate resistant weeds and now there''s a high percentage of weeds have glyphosate resistance. So, you know, you know, I think in some ways the life cycle of Roundup is is is kind of it''s going to be coming to an end on its own at some point. Limited by nature. >> It''s limited by nature and new products are coming out. But I will tell you this >> when you talk about safety of products. Well, let me back up and and just talk about uh the companies. I mentioned the three big companies that are controlling the egg input market. Bayer, Cortevans, and there''s other ones, but Bayer is a German company. >> Yes, Corteva is an American company. top shareholders of Black Rockck, Vanguard and State Street of that company. But Senta is a wholly owned state enterprise of the Chinese government actually >> 100%. So about somewhere on the on the uh end of 5 million acres in our state has chemicals and seed technology from a company that''s a wholly owned company of the state of China, the country of China. So I mentioned that to say this. If you talk to farmers about some of these products and you know uh like I said glyphosate or Roundup is you know very ubiquitous to see used but if you talk to them about products even many of them won''t use anymore you''ll get to products like Parakquad. Parakquad is uh actually it was really originally formulated by Sententa. Quot was used in uh anti-drug spraying in Latin America. It was very controversial for that >> and it and it it''ll burn down plants in a matter of hours. >> But it but if you''re exposed to paraquad your chance of Parkinson''s doubles. Matter of fact, >> actually >> Oh yes. >> Parkinson''s there''s people if you >> that''s something you don''t want to get. >> No. And if if you go on X and you type in and you just like look at parakqua, you''ll find stories of farmers who just will not use it anymore. They''ll they''ll tell stories of, you know, spraying it and immediately getting like or that day getting like uncontrollable bloody noses. It''s it''s a very very harsh product and it''s still spray. I think the estimate the best estimate is about 300,000 acres of of land in Iowa use this product. This product is actually used in research settings in mice and rodents to induce Parkinson''s. Are you being serious? I''m 100% serious. And our EPA, and this is where the big issue lies, our EPA still allows it. So, if we''re talking about like, are these are these products harmful? Like, we we can get into that more, but yes. Well, we know if it doubles your chance of Parkinson''s, you''re going to have to explain the upside to continue selling that product. I mean, my instinct is like, well, you''d ban that today. That''s and I think this is what what people >> Parkinson''s come on now that''s true suffering it yeah it''s it''s a sentence you don''t want >> no >> but when you you can research this your listeners can research this it is used to induce Parkinson''s in research settings >> I so so when I talk about these products you know I think what farmers want is to understand the truth to like know that their government is telling them the truth about these products E whiz, but as with many other things, the corporate capture is so heavy. And so when you talk about glyphosate or glyphosate based herbicides, Roundup is one of them. There''s many glyphosate based herbicides. The EPA studied this for years. Um, we know way more than we''ve ever known about this. And we also know that there are significant risks associated with its use. And so, for example, one of the most uh known cases is the uh case of the groundskeeper in California, the first major lawsuit against Monsanto. And this was a uh a man who was his job was to work for the school districts and spray glyphosate. And uh the hose broke on his on his pack or his in his little cart and it end up showering him with this product. In a matter of months, he had lesions all over his body. And he sends emails to Monsanto asking, "What should I do here?" I mean, they''re very like, "I need help." Like, not I''m trying to blame you. He''s like, "What? How what do I do to solve this problem?" Well, if you fast forward in that trial, the uh when they were in the discovery process, the judge agreed to make a large portion of the discovery confidential, meaning that it wasn''t, you know, wasn''t to be released, but the plaintiffs could uh challenge something or request the disclosure of it and they could request a meet and confer to talk about him. and they requested it at one point and the Monsanto attorneys I think literally said the words go away. We''re not going to disclose anything else. But then there''s Do I get to do that next time I get sued? Go away. >> Go away. And so but there was a stipulation in there that said if they didn''t if Monsanto didn''t put in there another request to continue the confidentiality within 30 days that the confidentiality was waved. They forgot to respond. And so now we have millions of pages of documents called the Monsanto papers. Millions. And in those documents, it is an absolute master class in corporate capture to the effect of you know that email that he sent to the company. They opened it. They read it. They forwarded around. What should we do here? And they just didn''t respond to him. I''m a man who''s like hurting, who''s oh the initial email. I''m covered in lesions from your product. What should I do? >> What should I do? Yeah, basically was asking for help. They read it, forwarded around. What do we do with this? Nobody responded to him. And there''s he sent two of those emails. I believe it was two. But in there''s also things like there was a time and place where another governmental body was going to be doing a study on the safety of glyphosate or Roundup on uh in this case. And the EPA official that Monsanto was working with at the time got wind of this and in the email with the with the Monsanto uh official, he''s recounting his conversation with this EPA official. And in it, he said this the official said to him on the phone, he quotes an email, if I can kill this, I should get a medal. And he did. He prevented this other governmental body from doing their own independent research on the safety and effectiveness of glyphosate of of Route. >> Come on now. This is real. This is out there. This is 2000. >> This is the regulator. >> This is the regulator. Yes. And so this is out there. And other egregious examples of and I say this to say this um very often I''m talking to farmers who I love who are my friends and my neighbors and my family and I am one of them. We actively farm our own land. I work with young farmers that, you know, to help them have an opportunity to be on land. We share crop, but I''m in there. I''m doing this. The most common comment I get from people is if it wasn''t safe, they wouldn''t let me use it. And I''m just here to say that''s a lie. Just like they were captured during COVID and the medical establishment captured agencies. Just like Bobby Kennedy is fighting right now and Donald Trump is fighting right now. These agencies have been captured for a long time and they''ve been lying to the consumers about the safety and efficacy of their products. And my whole goal here, I''m not here to sit and say we should ban X, Y, or Z. That''s not what I''m talking about. I mean think there''s certain things like parakquad probably should not be used. I mean of Parkinson''s like hard no. >> Hard no. It it shouldn''t be used. But what I want is good science so farmers can say do I want to use this product and we can say should this product be allowed and also know if I''m going to use this product this is how it should be used. I mean when you have commercials I mean we we know how glyphosate enters the bloodstr','{"synopsis": "On The Tucker Carlson Show, Tucker Carlson interviews Zack, a Republican candidate for governor of Iowa, who frames his candidacy around cultural preservation, ancestral heritage, and opposition to corporate consolidation in agriculture.

We''ll prepare for President Trump''s State of the Union address. And we''re going to analyze the top global box office at Weathering Heights, and explore what its perversity actually means for our civilization. But first, everyone knows what the legacy media is going to look like tonight. It''ll be somewhat depressing, somewhat dramatic. Caitlyn Collins will be a little outraged, but President Trump is going to be making his State of the Union, and you can hang out with us instead. We have our very own State of the Union watch party. It kicks off 8:00 p.m. Eastern with a live pre-show hosted by Cabbat Phillips. We''ll get you ready for President Donald Trump''s big night, which you can watch right here. And then once the speech is over, we''re just getting started. Stick around for a special edition of Friendly Fire hosted by MUA. Pre-show, State of the Union, Friendly Fire, all in one place. Watch with me, Andrew Claven, and special guests live tonight at dailywire.com and on the Dailyware Plus app on Roku, Samsung, Apple TV, and everywhere else. Now, I need to take a breath here because what I''m about to discuss is significantly more serious and truly troubling. Candace Owens, as you may have heard me refer at the top of the show, is an evil, twisted human being. Now, the reason I say that today is because Candace has spent the last several months attacking the widow of Charlie Kirk, Erica Kirk. It took her just a few days after Charlie''s sick murder in order to start casting aspersions at Turning Point USA, people who worked there all the way up to the highest levels up to and including Erica Kirk. She was doing that very, very quickly. And she''s been doing it for months. I mean, truly for months. I mean, yesterday she came out with something that she had announced she was doing, which is a series. This is a trailer for a series, a teaser trailer that is titled Bride of Charlie, which is supposedly now an expose on the evil, nefarious, predatory nature of Erica Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk, who again was shot in the neck not by some sort of vast conspiracy involving French intelligence and Egyptian airplanes, but by a transloving gay man who was a furry. That that is the actual story. And because Candace Owens is either going through the throws of mental illness or because she is a sick human being or both, she has decided that she is going to turn her fire on the widow. Don''t believe me? I know. Listen, there are a lot of people who listen to Candace. She has a huge audience. This is what she does. This is who she is. She is a conspiratorial evil person because that''s who would do something like this, a conspiratorial evil person. Now, the only reason that I''m playing this trailer is so you understand the extent of the evil that Candace Owens is perpetrating here because obviously I do not wish to promote her propagandistic horror that she is now pushing on a grieving widow with small children. The entire purpose of this is so you understand what Candace Owens is and what she is doing. I have to show you this thing so you understand that I''m not exaggerating, that I''m not making it up, that the thing that I''m saying is a thing Candace is doing because otherwise it would be kind of unbelievable. I get this all the time with regard to Candace. I get with regard to other personalities, too. But what happened to her? Does she really mean this stuff? Does she mean the kind of stuff that she says? Take her at her word. Here is what she is doing. Here is the trailer for her hot garbage fire of nonsense conspiracy mongering defecation. Here is the trailer she just released for her series of attacks. It''s going to be an entire series of attacks on Erica Kirk. Again, she''s been retailing and implying and basically saying out loud a lot of this stuff on her show for months. For months, people cannot claim that they were ignorant that this was happening. They know what was happening and they let it go. We''ll get to them in a moment, but here is the trailer that she released yesterday. President Trump says that Kirk has died after he was shot from a nearby building after being shot at Utah Valley University. >> The great and even legendary Charlie Kirk is dead. >> The cries of this widow will echo around the world like a battle cry. I don''t get to give him a kiss goodbye. That young man, I forgive him. >> Take your time. >> Erica Kirk has been named the new CEO of Turning Point USA. >> My husband''s dead. Like, I''m not trying to be morbid, but he''s dead. >> It''s weird to say excited. >> Describes her husband''s funeral as the event of the century. Merch hats. >> We have 50,000 plus hat orders. Nobody knows why she''s out there in a glittering pants suit in a recreated tent that her her husband tragically was murdered in throwing merch out. >> Everyone grieavves differently. So if someone''s acting weird, don''t read into that. >> Zionists, the prime minister of Israel, all lied through their teeth about Charlie Kirk. >> Her operation was in Constant, the epicenter of Romania''s trafficking scandal. weird conversations to have with a 15-year-old. I''m going to touch your butt. $8.6 million to their own shell company. What is going on? >> We have nothing to hide. >> My aunt used to tell me, "Never do something that you don''t want on the front page of a newspaper." So, that''s what Candace Owens has been spending her days doing. And millions of people, of course, have been watching her as she''s been doing this. Apparently, she is calling Erica Kirk, she has been calling Erica Kirk a lesbian pedophile grooming a 15-year-old. She is suggesting, of course, she has been suggesting for a while that TPUSA was complicit, if not in the murder of Charlie Kirk, than in the cover up of the murder of of Charlie Kirk. This is the stuff that Candace Owens has been doing because Candace Owens is a is a true vampire when it comes to conservatism and the conservative movement. She finds prominent people and then she grifts off of them and then she does more grifting off of them and then she grifts them until she''s done grifting them. Then she moves on to the next thing she can grift off of. Truly sick, truly evil. You You lack for words. There is a biblical injunction for those of us who actually care about the Bible. So, it''s a biblical injunction in Exodus 22 that you ought not to oppress any widow or orphan. Now, the reason that I focus in on this is because aside from the fact that Candace drives huge numbers through slandering people, truly slandering them, and yes, Erica Kirk absolutely should sue the living hell out of Candace Owens for this sort of stuff. The reason I bring this up is because there''s been a wide and vast silence by people who should have spoken out about this months and months and months ago. In fact, some of us were calling this out from the stage of TPUSA in December. Here''s what I had to say about Candace doing exactly this thing. This is back in December. Okay, it is now nearly the end of February and the same people who I suggested were silent then are silent now. So if Candace Owens decides to spend every day since the murder of Charlie Kirk casting aspersions at TPUSA and the people who work here who worked with Charlie every single day his best friends to cast dispersions at Mikey McCoy and Andrew Kovvin and Blake Nef and Tyler Ber and yes at Erica Kirk and to imply or outright claim complicity in a cover up over Charlie''s murder to spew absolutely baseless trash implicating everyone from French intelligence to MSAD to members of TPUSA in Charlie''s murder or a cover up in that murder, then we as people with a microphone have a moral obligation to call that out by name. Erica Kirk and TPUSA never never should have put in never should have been put in the position to have to defend themselves against such specious and evil attacks, particularly in a time of mourning. And the people who refuse to condemn Candace''s truly vicious attacks, and some of them are speaking here, are guilty of cowardice. Yes, cowardice. The fact that they have said nothing while Candace has been vomiting all sorts of hideous and conspiratorial nonsense into the public square for years is just as cowardly. When the signs are there for years on end and people say nothing and people continue to say nothing today, that''s cowardice, obviously. Where are Charlie''s friends? Where are Charlie''s closest friends? Where are all the people who proclaim solidarity with Charlie and with Erica today? What are they doing? And for all the people who are watching Candace stitch together a bunch of specious nonsense because they like the gossip of it because they enjoy the todry mory povich silliness of it because they''re watching a car crash at the side of the road. Please have some more respect for your own brain than that. Please have some more respect for yourself than that. Truly. Truly. Because what she is doing is evil. And when you watch her show, she gets paid to do that evil. That is how she is making her money. She is making money off the murder of Charlie Kirk by literally implicating his widow and everyone else at TPUSA in that murder and then trying to dig up pseudo dirt on the wife of the person who was murdered. I don''t know what to call that other than evil trash, but you are too smart for this. I mean, the fact is that while Candace Owens is obviously good at broadcasting, she''s very good on camera, she happens not to be a particularly smart human being. She just isn''t. I''m I''m sorry. I''m sorry to to break it to everybody. She is not some sort of magical genius guiding you through the mysteries of life, unpacking for you all of the secrets of how the world really works. She is a grifter who is making money off of you by telling you lies that are unbelievably stupid but evocative. In fact, that could be the name of her autobiography, Stupid but Evocative by Candace Owens. Except she would pronounce it evocative. Coming up, we''ll get to Chaos in New York. First, let''s be honest, most of us have no idea what phytonutrients are. That''s exactly why our sponsor, Balance of Nature, makes getting them in your diet, so simple. Here''s the thing about phytonutrients. They''re these naturally occurring plant nutrients and whole foods that actually give fruits and veggies their color, taste, and smell. And honestly, if you''re eating something with vibrant color and real flavor, it''s a pretty good sign you''re getting genuine phytonutrients.

Yesterday in New York City, there''s been this gigantic freeze that has set beset New York City and the rest of the East Coast. And as you will see on Washington Square, several NYPD officers responded to a call there and people started hurling snowballs at them. This isn''t like playful stuff. They were actually trying to hurt them. They started just hurling objects at the police officers. Every one of these people should be identified and every one of these people should go to jail. Every single one of them hurling objects at police officers, assaulting police officers, mobs of people, some of them masked trying to assault police officers. This is 1970s style disorder in New York City. And yes, it has been prompted and promoted by people like Zoron Mamani. The attitude that governance has toward people who are actual hoodlams in the streets has a pretty marketked impact on whether or not people act like hoodlams in the streets. Forget about broken windows theory. How about attacking cops theory? You attack a cop, you go to jail. Again, pretty simple stuff. But the rising level of disorder and chaos that we see in the country is a direct result of governance decisions that are being made in blue cities particularly by the people who run those blue cities. You think that has no impact on how people think of the cops that Zarani has spent his entire career prior to being elected mayor of New York ripping on the cops and suggesting that they are a nefarious force for viciousness. Of course it has an impact. Every single one of those people pelting the NYPD with snowballs should go to jail. And those are full grown adults, by the way. Those are not kids. You''re not talking about misbegotten 15-year-old juvenile delinquents who get frisky with the cops. You''re talking, look at that video again. You''re talking about people who are standing there. The cops arrive and they just start hurling things at the cops. Jessica Tish, who is the commissioner of the NYPD, put out a statement, quote, "The NYPD is aware of certain videos taken earlier today in Washington Square Park showing individuals attacking cops. I want to be very clear. The behavior depicted is disgraceful and it is criminal. Our detectives are investigating this matter. The PBA called the incident unacceptable and outrageous according to ABC7 in New York. The fact that this has become commonplace, this sort of attitude toward the cops has become commonplace really since 2014 in the country. In 2014, of course, you had the Ferguson riots justified then by the president of the United States. And then it turns out Americans didn''t like that. Donald Trump was elected. You saw reversion to a law and order attitude at the top and then in 2020 broke out a new again but far far far larger. And now you have blue cities that are being taken over by effectively defund the police advocates. And those defund the police advocates may then turn around and try to claim that they want to work with the cops, but it''s too late. Message received. Message received. Disorder comes from the top. It does not come from the bottom. A disordered government leads to a disordered citizenry. There''s a reason that law and order, it''s not just law, it''s also order have to be implemented. Speaking of Zoran Mani, Zoran Mamani is who has totally changed the policy in New York City with regard to getting people off the streets in the middle of, you know, blizzards and then bunch of people have died. He''s saying that the people dying, well, you know, it''s because they actually died of overdose, not because they are they are freezing. Well, I mean, I guess you''re doing a great job then, Merry uselessness. We have more than 500 homeless outreach workers who have been traversing the five burrows looking to connect homeless New Yorkers with services and support. And what we''ve also learned is the tools that were effective over the course of the prolonged cold period, again a historic period of sub freezing uh conditions, those are ones we''ve employed from the very first day of our response to this one. I''ll give you one example. A number of those New Yorkers who lost their lives, the preliminary indications came that it was from an overdose related death. Well, you know what helped is if you had forced those people to go inside. That''s what would have really helped. Or maybe if you just didn''t let people sleep in the outdoors at all, regardless of the weather, and then people would probably die less often of drug overdose on the street. And Mayor SMARMM over there, grins at the camera always. And then through that gritted, smarmy smile utters the most innane platitudes again. New Yorkers, you broke it, you bought it. Unfortunately, the disconnection of the Democrats runs the gamut. James Terico is a state representative in Texas who''s received outsized media attention because he''s sort of the beta or of this cycle. Every so often, Democrats decide that they''re going to win a Senate seat in Texas every couple of years and they run the hot new thing. So, they tried Beta. You remember Bato? Bet was a representative in the House of Representatives, ran for Senate, got smooshed. You remember that he was raising millions and millions of dollars because he betor was gonna bring Texas back to the blue bra. And then that that failed. Then he ran for president and then that also failed. Brah. And then he went to the New Mexican desert to eat dirt or something. Well, now they''re trying again with James Terico who kind of is b he feels like Texan Pete booty judge kind of. That that''s kind of the vibe for James Terico. He''s got the howdy duty thing going on. Anyway, when he''s not appearing on Joe Rogan to receive silly questions or when he is not appearing on Steven Coar to receive silly questions, he is out there suggesting that Americans ought not worry about radical Islam or say transgender shootings. They should worry about rich people. Okay, my dude. >> Trans people are 1% of the population. Mus Muslims are 1% of the population. Undocumented people are 1% of the population. We are focused on the wrong 1%. Um so um I''m just going to point out at this point that murderers represent a very small percentage of the American population. Should we not worry about like why is the percentage of the population the relevant categorization here? It''s a bizarre contention. I mean, is the contention that if transgenders were 20% of the population that we should worry more about them or that if Muslims were 10 because I feel like he wouldn''t say that. I feel like he wouldn''t say that if Muslims were 10% of the American population, we should be concerned. By the way, they''re like 10% of the New York population. So, I really don''t think that he''s making the argument that he thinks he''s making there. I I think what we really should worry about are not transgenders per se, but the phenomenon whereby we tell children that boys can be girls and then treat them with hormones and tell them that their mental illness is fixed. That seems to me a problem. Has nothing to do with the percentage of people affected. If a very small percentage of people in the United States believe that they are in fact Jack the Ripper, maybe it''s only one guy. It feels like telling him he''s Jack the Ripper and handing him a knife would also be a bad idea. It turns out bad ideas are bad ideas regardless of the percentage of population they cover. Why were supposed to quote unquote worry about the 1% being, you know, presumably the people who have participated the most in the market providing goods and services that others wish to obtain. That is how you get rich in a free country. You don''t get rich, contrary to popular opinion, by stealing from poor people because it turns out poor people don''t have lots of money. It turns out that in a free country the way that you get rich is through free exchange of goods and services. And if you do that lots of times and you invent cool new stuff that other people want, you can get real rich in the United States. I love that for James Terico, the threat to the American population is that a person who once was not rich is now extremely rich. And that''s a threat, but a threat to the population is not a transgender person picking up a gun and shooting up a Catholic school. Like that''s okay, my dude. The again, the the the level of disconnect here is astonishing. And here, you know what? I I have to say, again, partial credit to Gavin Newsome. It''s funny that I have to say this about Gavin Newsome, who again, I think Gavin Newsome is the the bizarre Patrick Baitman of American politics, shape-shifting in the extreme. But I will say that he at least has his finger on the pulse enough to understand that Americans don''t like the left-wing view on transgenderism very much. Here was Gavin Newsome explaining that actually Dems will will lose people if they don''t address trans athletes. Now, as I pointed out to him directly when I was sitting with him, I think the American people are going to be just as upset when they find out that you would like to trans children and that you think that that hormone treatments and surgeries for children are somehow morally justifiable. I feel like Americans care about that even more than boys playing in girls sports. But New Nome is at least willing to go this far >> from a a tactical perspective from the prism of purely politics. >> Um there''s no doubt that the Democratic Party needs to be dare I say more culturally normal. I believe that um less prone to spending disproportionate amount of time on pronouns, identity, politics, more focused on tabletop issues, things that really matter. the stacking distress in terms of electricity bills and child care costs and health care and obviously housing costs uh and how easily we get trapped in that how I''ve fallen prey to that. I mean here I was way out front on marriage equality. So I understand this from both in the receiving end of this and on the front end of this leading the pack. So I think there has to be some consideration of that. Uh but I think if you can''t hold the line on on on competitive sports again sports it''s a there''s some nuance in this larger conversation but competitive metal sports if we can''t find that nuance I think we''re going to lose a lot of people that aren''t we''re not going to get invited in a larger conversation. Now again like it''s weird that Gavin Newsome is the somewhat rational person at least like in very small part rational person in the Democratic room but that is how far left the Democratic party has moved. Speaking of which Senator Ruben Ggo of Arizona who would also like to run for president. He''s he''s one name that''s not being dropped very often but he certainly wants it. He is uh he''s now claiming that ICE detention centers are internment camps. The disconnect in the Democratic party is a real thing. >> In Arizona, for example, uh they just bought a $70 million warehouse, did not even speak to the governor, did not speak to any of the local city council members, which and the Republicans, uh you know, they''re setting up these interment camps. And yet, when we asked for very simple things, things that would actually bring trust, security, uh to our communities, they refused. If Democrats wish to run on ICE detention centers or internment camps, throw snowballs at the cops and leave the homeless out on the street to freeze and also billionaires are the real problem. I suppose they can do that. Doesn''t seem like the world''s smartest strategy to me. Tonight is the State of the Union address. The president of the United States giving his first official State of the Union address last year. I was there, but it wasn''t really a State of the Union. It''s kind of fake State of the Union. He went for 99 minutes last time. Like really, really long. He says he''s going to go long this time. When the president says he''s going to go long, calf up, man. It''s going to be long. I mean, make sure that you hydrate. Make sure that you have some carb packets on hand. When the president decides to go on a stem winder, I mean, I''ve I''ve been at many of his events. I will say I think the overunder on this thing is like 2 hours probably. There''s got to be a couchy market for this. Like the actual length of the president''s speech tonight. I I''d be shocked if they if there if there is not. There we go. Okay, so the overunder is 100 minutes or above. Apparently 48% of people believe he''s going to go for at least 100 minutes. 62% at least 95 minutes. So the overunder is an hour 40. I I say that he tops last year. I think that he has it in his head that he is going to go for it. Calia, by the way, is a sponsor of the show. Well, joining me on the line on this historic day is Mary Margaret Olahan. Mary Margaret is, of course, our White House correspondent. Mary, Margaret, good to talk to you. >> Hey, Ben. Great to be here. >> So, what can we expect from the president''s first official State of the Union tonight? Last year, he did a a kind of quasi state of the union. It wasn''t officially a State of the Union. This is his actual first second term State of the Union. So, what should we expect tonight? >> Well, we should expect a long State of the Union. Last year, I believe he went 99 minutes, and this year, he''s already told us that it''s going to be pretty long. So, I think we can expect it to be even longer than last year. Uh, but what Caroline Levit and the White House are saying is that this is going to be a celebration of America, of American patriotism, and of all the things the president has done during uh the first year of his administration. So, last year when he spoke, he''d only been in office for a few months. Uh now he has all of these different accomplishments that he can tout and you know that he will especially on the economy on the border crisis uh that he has handled effectively and on the deportations that he continues to do uh on his foreign policy wins uh making American city safer that those things and much much more. Uh he intends to have a number of guests and my understanding uh Melania will also have a few guests. All of these congressmen will have guests and and what I have been told is that these guests are supposed to be American people who showcase uh the beauty of America, the beauty of our workers, uh the strength of the American person in general. Uh and all of this will contribute to a spectacle which from the Trump administration''s perspective will be one of the most watched speeches of the president''s year if not the next several years. All eyes are on the president. uh all the cable news channels will be tuned in which is not something that they always do. So the Trump administration is excited. Uh they know the eyes of the world are watching and they''re planning to take full advantage of that. So Mary Margaret, the president is famous for not only some surprises that he has dropped during addresses like this in in the past, but also for his guest election, which is always really really interesting. Do we have any indicators of of who he might be inviting on a more specific level? >> Yes. Yes. So, Ben, we can exclusively report here at Daily Wire that President Trump will be bringing Erica Kirk, the widow of the late Charlie Kirk as his guest to the State of the Union this year. Uh we learned this from the White House that Erica, who as we know has taken over as the head of Turning Point USA. Uh she will be attending as a president''s guest. And I''m also told by a White House official that Trump plans to talk about the tremendous revival of faith, Christianity, and belief in God and in our country. Since Charlie''s death, we know that across the the nation, if not the world, we have seen this amazing spiritual revival, uh especially young people turning to their faith, uh turning to to God, to Jesus Christ in an attempt to find solace after Charlie''s death and to follow his admonition that the most important thing for uh any individual is their faith in their God. Uh, and I''m also told by the Trump administration that the president plans to firmly reject political violence against our fellow citizens. Uh, so he will make a plea to Congress that all Congress members should reject political violence. And this comes only a few days after we heard of yet another incident of apparent political violence against the president when the Secret Service shot and killed a man who is attempting to enter the Winter White House, Mara Lago, and Palm Beach. Uh I''m told that uh they''re still looking into this. The FBI is still investigating this incident. Um but this is I I believe the third or the fourth instance of a man attempting to take the president''s life and it also comes after Charlie''s tragic assassination.

I have some pretty marketked critiques of this movie, Withering Glutes, because it speaks to the complete and utter degradation of our entire culture. Truly, it is a disastrously bad film. My producers originally made me watch this so I could do a YouTube video on it, and I''m actually putting it in the episode because I think it is that important. And it speaks to where we are as a civilization and a culture because there are sort of cultural bellweathers. What are the things that become important? What does it say about a country when the most popular movie that is put out is basically music video pornography and a complete destruction of the underlying cultural value of the original novel and of the 1939 movie. It actually does speak to that. So, before all the ladies in the audience or or all the people who are listening to the sound of my voice take their girlfriends or wives to see this piece of absolute gutter trash, true trash, I would recommend that they actually sit for a second, head on over to Amazon and get the original Weathering Heights, the film with Lawrence Olivier and Merl Oberon. It is significantly better in every possible way. It is possible for a film to be better. Why? Because the values are better. Okay. So the reason I want to talk about this is because the pornification of our society, a society in which people are not having children, in which people are not even having sex, the the complete destruction of true eroticism in our society. That is what is happening with Weathering Heights. Weathering Heights, as I say, is basically just BDSM pornography shoveled into a very, very bad version of the kind of quasi framework of the plot of Weathering Heights. And the truth is that all of the elements that build a successful society can be found in the ways that societies view marriage and virtue and love and romance. And when that turns into what you see in the new version of the movie, which is basically just lust, materialism versus lust is basically the thrust of the film. No pun intended. When We Wthering Heights becomes Withering Glutes, then you''ve basically cooked your society. It is cooked. You want to know why people aren''t having children? You want to know why people are having less sex? You want to know why life is actually more porn more pornified and less erotic? This is why. This is why. Okay, so I''m going to get into the actual details of the film for just a second, which again, a lot of people are going to see it this weekend. And it speaks to the destruction of the relationship between the sexes and what women think of themselves and how they think of sex and romance and how men think of this sort of stuff. So in order to do that I sort of have to contrast what a good version of a movie looks like of Weathering Heights and what a horrible version of a movie looks like. The good version would be the 1939 version which was written by Charles MacArthur, Ben Heck, and John Houston. And the terrible version is the Emerald Fennel version. The the original Weathering Heights, the 1939 version, happens to be again one of the great movies of all time. I''ve talked about this in the past that you can look at movies made in the 1940s and movies made today and you can see the differentiation in values. To take a perfectly obvious example in the world of Disney, if you go all the way back to the original Pinocchio, which was made in the 40s, like the beginning of the 40s, the original Pinocchio has the line from Jimny Cricket and always let your conscience be your guide. And there''s a right, there''s a wrong, always let your conscience be your guide. Frozen, the most popular Disney movie for this generation, the most famous song from it is no right, no wrong, no rules, I''m free, right? Just a completely difference in values. Okay, so in 1939 version, here is how the plot of Weathering Heights goes. And it''s it''s important to go through the plot synopsis so you understand the differences and why those differences were inserted into the film. So in the 1939 version of Weathering Heights, which is much more heavily based on the novel, basically you have a an estate. It is called Weathering Heights. It''s perfectly fine place. Everybody''s happy. There''s a father, Mr. Ernshaw, and he has a couple of kids, Henley and Kathy. And one day, he brings home a foundling. And the foundling is Heathcliffe. And he''s described in the movie and in the original books as sort of dark and gypsy looking. He''s supposed to be a representative of the lower classes. And the father brings him home because he''s trying to make the point that you actually have to be charitable toward people in the lower classes because there is an innate equality of human beings. Kathy not only accepts this, she becomes originally best friends with Heath Cliff when they''re children and then lovers with Heath Cliffe. Not like they''re having sex or anything in the movie. They''re not. But they clearly love one another. So much so that because Heathcliffe is abused by the brother, right? The brother becomes jealous. Hindley, who''s the brother, becomes jealous and beats him up and treats him horribly. And when the father dies, relegates Heath Cliff to being a stable boy. It''s basically a fairy tale gone wrong. He relegates him to to being a stable boy. And Kathy is still in love with him. Okay, so this creates the central conflict for Kathy. Okay, her central conflict in the 1939 movie is twofold. First, there''s the conflict between love, like passionate love with Heath Cliff, who wants to run away with her, and material prosperity, which was historically a very real concern for women, particularly at the time that the book was written back in the 19th century. Because again, if you run away with a guy into the middle of she says this in the film, if you run away with a guy and you just live on the countryside, that''s a very bad life. And so she has to make the decision, does she wish for eternal love with Heathcliffe or does she want to marry the boy next door basically who is an upper class kind of posh but not a terrible person who she clearly doesn''t love but will usher her into a world of plenty and material comfort and sort of wealth. That''s the decision that she originally has to make and she tries to solve it a couple of ways in the 39 movie. At the beginning, she tells Heath Cliff, "Why don''t you go out into the world, go make your fortune, come back to me?" And he says, "I can''t leave you. I''m that attached to you. If I leave you, I will I will fall apart." And he at one point, he does try to leave and he comes back because he misses her too much. So that''s the original conflict. And at a certain point, she''s proposed to by the boy next door, and she says to a maid that she wants to accept because to Mary Heathcliffe would be beneath her. And so she has this sort of two-sided personality with regard to Heath Cliff. On the one hand, she loves him deeply and she wants to be with him and she identifies with him. On the other hand, she wants to be she aspires to be a person of material comfort and wealth and leisure and all the rest of this sort of stuff. 80,000 babies. That''s how many lives were saved last year through our sponsor pre-born and their supporters like you. Right now, thousands of women are being told the same heartbreaking lie that abortion is the only choice. That they''re on their own, that there''s no way forward. But everything shifts the moment an expectant mother walks into a pre-born network clinic and sees her baby on that ultrasound screen. In that instant, her chance of choosing life doubles. Suddenly, it''s not abstract anymore. It''s her baby created in God''s image. A sacred life meant to be cherished and protected. When she hears that heartbeat for the very first time, a divine bond is formed. Right now, my wife is pregnant with our fifth. Every single time we see an ultrasound, it is just a miracle. It''s unbelievable. I''m seeing my child''s profile like right now. Today, we can all support a mother in need. A donation of just 28 bucks provides one ultrasound that could save a life and impact generations to come. Let''s make this the biggest life-saving year we''ve ever seen. Call pound 250. Say the word baby. That''s pound 250 baby. Or visit pre-born.com/ben to donate securely today. Again, that''s pre-born.com/ben.born.com/ben. And so she says to the maid, "Maybe I should marry the guy next door, Lyndon Edgar." Lindon, maybe I should do that. And because Heathcliffe is beneath me and Heath Cliff happens to be overhearing this and so he runs away. And so she ends up marrying Linton. And that''s the that''s sort of the first conflict. Then you get to the second part of the plot. The second part of the plot is that Heath Cliffe now comes back. She''s married to Linton. And now the conflict is she''s still in love with Heathcliffe. She has this eternal love with Heathcliffe, but virtue is the problem. Right? So again, notice the conflicts here which are actually real and interesting. the conflict between material comfort versus privation or eternal love, passionate but risky. That''s the original conflict. And then it moves into love versus virtue. She''s married and not only is she married, Heathcliffe comes back and Heathcliffe decides that as almost a form of emotional revenge against her, he is going to marry Lyndon''s sister. And so Isabella, who is also a good character in the 39 movie, she''s not a milk. She''s not ridiculous. She falls in love with Heath Cliff believing that she can make him love her back, which of course is untrue. And when that happens, that''s when Kathy realizes she''s ruined not just herself, but also Heath Cliff and goes into sort of a death spiral. And you get this very, very famous last scene in the 1939 film. Here is a couple of minutes of that famous last scene where it looks like Kathy is dying. And here is the incredibly romantic famous last scene of the movie. Miss Gabby. Oh my wild heart. Miss Gabby. She''s gone. >> You''ve done your last black deed. He leave this house. She''s at peace now in heaven beyond us. What do they know of heaven or hell? Kelly who know nothing of life. Oh, they''re praying for you, Kathy. I''ll pray one prayer with them. I repeat, till my tongue stiffens. Katherine Ernaw, may you not rest so long as I live on. I killed you. Haunt me then. Haunt your murderer. I know that ghosts have wandered on the earth. Be with me always. Take any form. Drive me mad. Only do not leave me in this dark alone. For I cannot find you. I cannot live without my life. I cannot die without my soul. Oh, my dear. You know, that is what a good version of the film looks like. Why? Because what that film is about is about longing. Unfulfilled longing. Right? That Heath, Cliff, and Kathy never get together. In fact, the only way it is possible for them to get together is in death. And one of the things he says to her near the end of the film is, "Why don''t you want to live?" And she says, "I want to die." Because she knows the only way out because she''s married. The only way out is death. And so, she wants to die. And then he wants to die and she ha he asks her to haunt him. I mean that that''s unbelievably romantic stuff obviously because these are deep conflicts and they go to the value of virtue because virtue is important and romance is important and and she apologizes for having been materialistic for having thrown away love in favor of material comfort. It''s deeply moving, right? It''s a wonderful wonderful film. Okay, now fast forward to 2026 and the new the new version, Glistening Butts from Emerald Fennel. It is insulting. It is degrading. And it is stupid. Truly, it is a stupid movie. It is stupid in every possible way for it to be stupid. Where''s the conflict? At the beginning, at least you sort of understand, okay, fine. It''s kind of lust versus materialism, I guess, kind of. But she has no moral scruples, so why can''t she have both? And when he comes back and instead of them being forced apart by virtue because virtue no longer exists in 2026. Virtue is not of any importance, he comes back and they immediately get together and they start doing the dirty all over the place. Like full scale minutes long montages of them banging. So where is the where is the plot tension? It does not exist. There''s no plot tension. She''s pregnant in the 2026 version with another man''s child, with her husband''s child. She tells Heathcliffe this, and we''ll get into the perverseness of all the sexual viewpoints in the movie in a second, because they they really are perverse. Instead of of this being an obstacle even to them being together, he says, "I''m more turned on by the fact that another man''s child is in you," which is like, "What?" Okay, so you even took away the the whatever whatever perverse values you have. You even took away the plot tension there. It makes no sense at all. And then she says, "Well, I can''t be together with you." And so he marries the sister just as he would in the 39 version, but he overtly tells the sister he is going to abuse her. He says, "I''m going to be horrible to you. I hate you. I''m never going to love you. Do you want it?" And because she too is a lusty little creature, she says, "Absolutely, I want it." Down to the point, as we''ll discuss, of full BDSM with him where he is treating her, I kid you not, as a dog. And then the baby within her dies. She dies of septasemia. She''s on the bed dead before he even gets back. And that''s the end of the film. It''s a horror show. And it''s a horror show because you got rid of actual love in favor of lust, actual romance in favor of sex, actual virtue in favor of literally nothing. And yes, eroticism. It is not an erotic film. It is not a sexy film. It is not an interesting film. Close-up shots from Withering Heights of Thundering Nips do not make up for lack of romance. Particularly, by the way, for women, there''s a reason that women read romance novels and men watch pornography. Because men and women do not think about sex and romance in the same way. Women like there to be a plot. They like there to be an overarching structure of feeling before you get to the sex. Which is why you can watch an entire movie from 1939 and it can be erotic without there being any sex or barely any kissing in it because the romantic tension is the thing and in fact this by the way is the way we used to build entire societies. What we used to say is yes we know sex is a very important part of life. The human mind is driven toward the forbidden libido is driven toward the forbidden. This is true in pretty much every society and it is a universal of human nature. And therefore what we do is we take sex and we hide it behind marriage. If you want to get to the forbidden, you have to do this responsible thing. Which is why the culmination of every classic comedy is a marriage. Because now you''re in the realm of virtue, but you can do the thing that was once forbidden and it''s no longer forbidden and it''s good and it''s plentiful and it''s healthy. And instead what we did is we obliterated as a society everything that was forbidden. All the walls came down. When there''s no virtue, there are no walls. There''s nothing forbidden. And so if there''s nothing forbidden, you have to get wilder and wilder and wilder in search for the new high. It''s basically a dopamine drug. That that is where we are as a society. Which is why apparently the new sexiness of Weathering Heights/beckoning abs apparently the the new sexiness is just bizarre sexual perversion, which is what actually happens in the film. And again, this is not about prudy. That is just what the film is. I''m not that short, but you know what is short?

That''s my honest belief. And I believe it''s not just in Iowa, it''s across the country. But when I look around and see people that were running for office, it was all about policy. It''s all about here''s this tax rate or you know this regulation needs to be changed and I just thought no one is standing up to say we have to get the culture right first. We have to step in and say what does it mean to be an American? What does it mean to be an Ian? And are the traditions and the heritage and the value of our ancestors important to us? And that''s the in the deepest part of my heart what motivates me in something like this. I actually don''t want to be a politician. I bet I''ve not had interest in it. You know, I uh spent a lot of my life in the private sector and building schools and uh I have a I have a pretty good life. I have a great family and a wife who loves me and supports me. Uh but you know in um you know uh 1850 my family came over from Germany and great great grandpa built our farmhouse uh and we had that same house on this piece of land in Iowa until 2005 and my great-grandmother passed away and I can still remember my grandma called me and she said, "Zack, you wouldn''t want anything to this old farmhouse, would you?" And I had, you know, graduated from high school in Iowa. I was off in college and I said, "No, I''m I''m there''s something better out here. I''m I''m off to get something to find something better. And then uh a number of years later, I was driving by to see my other great-grandmother who lived to be 103. Um and I drove by the old farm and I just drove up. I said, "Hey, could I take a look around?" And they said, "Yeah." I said, "You know, my great great grandpa built this. He was a thirdass passenger on the SS Wand coming from Hamburg, Germany as a 14-year-old. He was in the stowage. That''s where he traveled over to America. and uh he became a carpenter and then earned enough money to buy the farm and build it with his uncle. And I said, "Hey, if you''re ever thinking about selling it, will you please let me know and it I just didn''t think anything coming that that time." But uh a couple years later, they called me and said, "Hey, we''re going to sell this farm. Would you want?" I''m like, "Yes." I don''t know how I''m going to do it, but uh I end up scraping together enough money to get an FHA loan, a down payment, and I bought the farm. And then since that time in 2014, I''ve been working to re rebuild it and restore it. And is the house still there? >> House is still there. You know, when I bought it, it was, you know, covered in vinyl. It it it had been completely changed on the outside. Um >> Yeah. 150 years is a long time. >> Yeah. And and being completely changed the outside. But I went to my my dad''s cousin Peter and he just kind of had the repository of great grandma''s photos. And so I got this pallet of boxes of photos and I spent I''m not I''m not kidding hundreds of hours going through photos and I was looking for every photo I could find of this old farmhouse. And I''ll tell you to anybody who wants to be radicalized on what we''ve lost as a culture, spend that much time going through your great-grandmother''s photos. >> Yeah. >> And you''ll realize the community, the traditions, the pride. I''ve done it. >> A lot of it''s gone. It''s unrecognizable. >> unrecognizable. And so I did that and uh I found every single picture I could find and I put the house back together board by board, counted every single piece of sighting, make sure it matched, and now we live in the home that was built by my great great-grandfather. Um, and I I tell people I didn''t do that so I could run for governor. I mean, the I started doing this over 10 years ago. I did it because I wanted my children to understand their story and that their heritage and their culture, what built them, the man who built this house, who I bet hoped someday my kids would live in it. Yes. But knew he would never meet them, that that story matters deeply. And so that''s what really got me into this. you know, uh, I was not looking to run for for this seat. And as I was talking to my wife about this, the current governor of Iowa, who by the way has done a very good job. I mean, we''re likely other than Florida, maybe the one of the most conservative states, and she''s done a great job at that. >> He''s a nice person. >> Yeah. Um, you know, when um we were looking at this, my wife said, you know, the seat hasn''t been open in 20 years. And there are issues in our state that are not dealing with taxes, that are not dealing with regulations, that are systemic, deep issues that are really causing our people to be hurt. And I talk about them all the time. And it was kind of from her this moment of hey, you know, put up or stop talking about it because this is an opportunity to go make real change. And so that''s why I''m running. So you said there are systemic issues that are not included in the normal pallet of politician concerns, which would be taxes and regulation. >> How just in order of importance, can you go through a few of them? Well, I think you know I I''ve spent my life uh in large part as an entrepreneur and uh in businesses organization I''ve run or started I have key metrics that I''m tracking to know the health of my my companies or the health of an organization you know I think I think on that list for a state is the physical climate of it that''s no doubt that''s part of it like can people afford to live here yes that''s a big part of course but the other there''s other deeper issues that I think are more long- term firm and focus that we, you know, because of this like constant news cycle of what''s happening right now that we all have to respond to, which thank god I''m not running for a federal office because it''s like never ending and always changing. But because of um because of that, often we''re distracted or our eyes are taken off the ball purposefully from the big issues. And a couple of them are this. Iowa''s number four in the nation for net out migration of our kids 25 to 29. >> Yeah. How can you build a state if your people are leaving? Important new people. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, we can talk about that. Um, another one would be, you know, 25% of our farmlands now owned by out of state investors and funds that don''t live in our state. So, our farmers who have had this ancestral connection to the land are now becoming tenants again. something we left Germany in large part for. You know, just take a side quest here for a second. I remember when I was doing a lot of that research in my family to understand a lot about the history and uh and what drove them to leave this homeland of theirs, you know, cuz I always made up, you know, 3540% German immigrants came over, very industrious people, very family oriented people, uh people that had pride in the work that they do. objectively some of the best people ever. I would I would say that >> I''m not one of them, but I just I I just have noticed. >> Oh, big on tradition and and um and big on family and uh a lot of pride in where they came from. So, what would motivate people to leave? And you know, I think the common answer we always heard was well, it''s religious persecution. And so, I started to get interested in this just to understand more what were the real conditions. And I actually found out that uh you know my family a lot of Germans came over around 1850. Well in 1848 in Germany there was an attempted revolution >> across across Europe. >> Across Europe. Yes. And it was called the 48ers. And what did they want? They well they wanted to be able to own the ground under their feet. They wanted free speech. They didn''t like slavery. They had a lot of these you know now what we call western ideals. >> It was the end of feudalism. Right. >> Yes. Right. And so what happened to them? They were defeated. And so in Germany when they''re defeated, many of them got exiled and then many others just left. Well, what state came online in 1846 was Iowa. And it was also very agrarian just like where they came from. And so many people came over. And I like to talk about this that you know uh one of the key points in Iowa''s history that I''m most proud of is how Ians responded during the Civil War. So, you know, uh we had the Missouri Compromise. We had the Kansas Nebraska Act. Um, and with that with that decision of, you know, they sort of get to decide whether or not they''re going to be free or slave, there was a lot of wealthy landowning elites that were rushing to the Midwest to try to lobby to create slave states, >> of course, >> and this Iowa >> plantations on the prairie, >> right? And Iowa was not a part of this, you know. Um, but one of my favorite stories in 1861, the governor of Iowa, his name was uh, Governor Samuel Kirkwood, he was on his plow in his field when a messenger from the Department of War brought a a message on horseback to him and in it the president said he needed to uh, put together a company of 750 troops to be ready in 2 weeks. And mind you, this is 15 years after Iowa became a state. I mean, we''re in our infancy. And he said, 750 troops in two weeks. How can that be done? And two weeks later, 10,000 Ians had signed up. By the end of the Civil War, more Ians fought in the Civil War than any other state per capita. Why was that? I believe and there''s some evidence of course I I read deeply in this that they had just left a country that they saw oppression in and they fled that left everything and they were saying this isn''t going to happen here and so I think when you talk about land and you talk about now 25% of our land is now owned by people that don''t live in our state they''re not contributing to our communities they don''t go to the football games they''re not shopping on Main Street it''s a real generational issue and I go to these auctions. I''ve bid against many of these people. >> Land auctions. >> Oh yeah. And very often it''s a farm management company. The actual owner. We don''t know who they are. We actually don''t know who owns our land in Iowa. There''s not human level disclosure that''s required. So you can own land in an LLC and that LLC could be wholly owned by a trust and all the state knows is that the LLC owns the land. That''s it. And so we''ve gotten to this place where just common courtesy or you know just common tradition of knowing who your neighbors are is not there anymore. >> Well, it''s impossible. >> Yeah. in in in can''t find their names, it''s kind of hard to have a community. It''s buried. America''s ranchers helped build this country. For over 250 years, ranchers fed America through droughts, wars, pandemics, every other kind of chaos. Our friends at Good Ranchers built their company on that honorable legacy. Good Ranchers is a meat company. It''s 100% committed to America. They raise every cut on local American soil.

That''s code Tucker for an extra 25 bucks off the order on top of $500 you''ll save this year for subscribing. Goodranchers.com. American meat delivered. And so one of the things as governor that I want to do is require human level disclosure of land ownership because I would bet that that''s actually more than 25% of our lands. >> Of course it is owned by people. So then another two other ones by the way if you don''t you know have to bear the consequences of your actions then you''re much more likely to exploit and degrade the community that you''re taking money from. So, like, why wouldn''t you? I mean, why do you care about long-term best practices? You don''t. You''re just extracting wealth. This is the spiritual part of the discussion, I believe. You know, I I was my father was a 30-year conservationist and a pastor. And um I grew up like learning to love and appreciate the place. I I tell I''ve said this before, but you know, he legitimately made me believe that every sunset was made for me by God. Amen. we would we''d be driving and say, "Look at what God made for you." And I still think to those things to this day of just like those little pieces that made me appreciate creation. And one of my favorite clips from your show ever, ever is when you were on with uh Bobby Kennedy and he was having that discussion about how nature is how we connect deeply with God. >> Yeah, it makes me emotional thinking about it. I couldn''t agree more. I sent that to so many people and especially my father because it it''s true and it''s language we don''t use anymore. It brings you to a higher place and it helps you understand like >> this is much deeper than just who owns a piece of land or what''s happening. It''s it''s actually like we are connected to God through the land through his creation. It''s on every page of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. It''s there''s a lot of nature. >> It''s what''s what''s the Garden of Eden filled with? Trees, rivers, >> animals. Right. Okay. >> And all the parables that have to do with that. Of course. So, so that of course the that''s a systemic issue and let me say that that''s been going on for a long time and nobody''s really talked about it. You go to a cafe, every farmer is talking about these things about like, oh, you see the We had a piece of land in Northwest Iowa uh recently go for $32,000 an acre. Not development land. Okay. I''m interested I''m a land buyer. I''m interested in land. I''m interested, you know, and all that. How do you get to $32,000 an acre even for, you know, famously productive farmland? Like, what is that? What''s the potential return on that? How did that happen? >> Well, let''s just say commonly we''ll go to $20,000 an acre. That''s fairly common in Northwest Iowa. It''s some of the best land in the world. Bonkers. >> It is. It is. And so, you know, look, PE outside investors look at Iowa as as a great investment because it''s a solid asset. >> Yes. It''s a hedge against the dollar of course >> and you get a dividend like you rent out the land like and so one of the things I I kind of complain or real pine about a lot is that our land isn''t an asset class. It''s actually was meant as the inheritance for the sons and daughters of our state to build their lives, their communities, and their families. And when they''re tenants on that land and they''re paying high dollar rent, because the only way you can justify high a high uh price like that is very high rent. um you you''re stripping away a lot of go back to say it''s like kind of the spiritual aspect of this and that land is best when it''s owned and farmed by the same person. it. We know this. We know this from if you own rental properties or whatever it might be. Like there''s a connection of stewardship that comes with that to know that I''m passing this piece of ground on to my grandkids and their kids and their kids and that''s what it should be. But that that is being actively taken away in our state. And so two other things that I I think are big systemic issues that are on my scorecard as I''d say is one is our farmers are actively being exploited by big egg companies. When I was growing up uh born in Iowa, we had over 300 seed and input companies, you know, fertilizer and and agrochemical companies that were selling to our farmers. Today that number''s three that control 85% of the market. Over 90% of seed technology is owned by two companies. >> Monsanto >> actually it''s uh Bayer and Corteva own 90% of this of the uh which owns Monsanto now. Yeah. >> See technology. >> No I of course but I forgot that Monsanto doesn''t actually exist anymore. Does it? >> I don''t think so. >> They changed the name. Yeah. It was bought by Bear in Germany. >> Yeah. They''re they''re sure mentioned a lot in court still but yeah they''re not um they''re not a company. So if you look at the long-term trend that anytime there''s a rise in commodity prices, these input costs go up even though there''s not a direct correlating factor. You know, there''s a study out of the University of Illinois and this study compared the cost of farming in Brazil to the cost of farming in Illinois, Iowa basically. And you have to understand that the three big companies in America that provide these inputs are also the same three big companies of Brazil. Bayer, Corteva, and Sententa. That study said that for growing corn using the same application rate that they''re charging Brazilian farmers about $150 less per acre than they are Iowa farmers. How? Well, the real answer is because they''re an unchecked monopoly and competition doesn''t exist. There''s tacic collusion. But he here''s how it actually works. They they have what they call regionalbased pricing. But what it really is is this. When they look at uh their pricing, they base it on the yield that you''re going to create. So let''s say you have more productive land, even though you''re using the same amount of product, they''re going to take more. you have less productive land even though you use the same amount of product, they''re going to take more. It''s it''s wrong, you know, and I will I will give credit to Brooke Rollins and Donald Trump and the administration. They''re talking about bringing antirust and and investigating this with Department of Justice. And one of the things I pledged to do that if I''m governor of Iowa, I''m going to lead the charge to bring antitrust suits against these companies that are exploiting our farmers because they''re taking every dollar they possibly can. And we''re already on life support. I mean, many many most farms are operating at a loss right now. And when you talk to farmers about this, you do not and like I can''t emphasize this enough, you do not hear them talk about tariffs. They''re not. Matter of fact, the price of soybeans this year with the tariffs was higher than it was last year before the tariffs. The change came that the cost of growing went up. I mean, the cost of the input products that they''re that they''re using went up. And so I I tell people all the time, the tariffs are not the issue. We have to get this unchecked monopoly under in check and under control. >> Obviously inputs are essential uh to agriculture well to any creating anything. Um one of them is diesel fuel. Not a lot of movement there. But then you have the products that you just mentioned seeds and fertilizer. Taking out seeds. Let''s just focus on fertilizer. What are the products like? Well, um I mean it just depends on on the most common product, you know, for fertilizers in hydro ammonia. It''s uh used in the fall. It''s where a lot of lot of um the nitrogen comes from. But then you have other products uh that are, you know, uh you know, um products from Earth, you know, potassium, pot ash, uh those things. Uh but you look at the the trend of the pricing in these you know um I think it was five years ago in the past five years nitrogen fertilizers went up 150% and the price of corn''s down 2%. So farmers are they''re really being I would say extorted in this process. You obviously want to sleep well and fashionably Brooklyn bedding can help.

Tell you something I was really surprised by and I don''t know much about it, but I was hunting on a farm in November right before Thanksgiving, a big big big working farm. And I was with the ranch manager and um in a truck and he said, "This is the truck we used to spray Roundup." And I said, "People using Roundup? I don''t You know, I''m not in the egg business. I thought Roundup was bad. >> Yeah. >> Again, I''m I''m very ignorant, but I just thought I didn''t realize that people were still spraying Roundup. He said, "Oh, everyone sprays Roundup. Like, everybody does." And we kind of don''t talk about it. And I''m like, "Hm, I mean, is that I''m not attacking Roundup specifically, but like are we sure that these chemicals are all safe?" Well, you know, well, Roundup is the most uh high it''s the most highly used herbicide in the history of the country or history of the world. >> It''s so effective. I mean, I''ve seen >> it''s been it''s losing its effectiveness greatly. It now has Oh, yeah. It has to be Yeah. You''ll have um different mixtures now that''ll go in because they''re we''re getting Roundup resist glyphosate resistant weeds and now there''s a high percentage of weeds have glyphosate resistance. So, you know, you know, I think in some ways the life cycle of Roundup is is is kind of it''s going to be coming to an end on its own at some point. Limited by nature. >> It''s limited by nature and new products are coming out. But I will tell you this >> when you talk about safety of products. Well, let me back up and and just talk about uh the companies. I mentioned the three big companies that are controlling the egg input market. Bayer, Cortevans, and there''s other ones, but Bayer is a German company. >> Yes, Corteva is an American company. top shareholders of Black Rockck, Vanguard and State Street of that company. But Senta is a wholly owned state enterprise of the Chinese government actually >> 100%. So about somewhere on the on the uh end of 5 million acres in our state has chemicals and seed technology from a company that''s a wholly owned company of the state of China, the country of China. So I mentioned that to say this. If you talk to farmers about some of these products and you know uh like I said glyphosate or Roundup is you know very ubiquitous to see used but if you talk to them about products even many of them won''t use anymore you''ll get to products like Parakquad. Parakquad is uh actually it was really originally formulated by Sententa. Quot was used in uh anti-drug spraying in Latin America. It was very controversial for that >> and it and it it''ll burn down plants in a matter of hours. >> But it but if you''re exposed to paraquad your chance of Parkinson''s doubles. Matter of fact, >> actually >> Oh yes. >> Parkinson''s there''s people if you >> that''s something you don''t want to get. >> No. And if if you go on X and you type in and you just like look at parakqua, you''ll find stories of farmers who just will not use it anymore. They''ll they''ll tell stories of, you know, spraying it and immediately getting like or that day getting like uncontrollable bloody noses. It''s it''s a very very harsh product and it''s still spray. I think the estimate the best estimate is about 300,000 acres of of land in Iowa use this product. This product is actually used in research settings in mice and rodents to induce Parkinson''s. Are you being serious? I''m 100% serious. And our EPA, and this is where the big issue lies, our EPA still allows it. So, if we''re talking about like, are these are these products harmful? Like, we we can get into that more, but yes. Well, we know if it doubles your chance of Parkinson''s, you''re going to have to explain the upside to continue selling that product. I mean, my instinct is like, well, you''d ban that today. That''s and I think this is what what people >> Parkinson''s come on now that''s true suffering it yeah it''s it''s a sentence you don''t want >> no >> but when you you can research this your listeners can research this it is used to induce Parkinson''s in research settings >> I so so when I talk about these products you know I think what farmers want is to understand the truth to like know that their government is telling them the truth about these products E whiz, but as with many other things, the corporate capture is so heavy. And so when you talk about glyphosate or glyphosate based herbicides, Roundup is one of them. There''s many glyphosate based herbicides. The EPA studied this for years. Um, we know way more than we''ve ever known about this. And we also know that there are significant risks associated with its use. And so, for example, one of the most uh known cases is the uh case of the groundskeeper in California, the first major lawsuit against Monsanto. And this was a uh a man who was his job was to work for the school districts and spray glyphosate. And uh the hose broke on his on his pack or his in his little cart and it end up showering him with this product. In a matter of months, he had lesions all over his body. And he sends emails to Monsanto asking, "What should I do here?" I mean, they''re very like, "I need help." Like, not I''m trying to blame you. He''s like, "What? How what do I do to solve this problem?" Well, if you fast forward in that trial, the uh when they were in the discovery process, the judge agreed to make a large portion of the discovery confidential, meaning that it wasn''t, you know, wasn''t to be released, but the plaintiffs could uh challenge something or request the disclosure of it and they could request a meet and confer to talk about him. and they requested it at one point and the Monsanto attorneys I think literally said the words go away. We''re not going to disclose anything else. But then there''s Do I get to do that next time I get sued? Go away. >> Go away. And so but there was a stipulation in there that said if they didn''t if Monsanto didn''t put in there another request to continue the confidentiality within 30 days that the confidentiality was waved. They forgot to respond. And so now we have millions of pages of documents called the Monsanto papers. Millions. And in those documents, it is an absolute master class in corporate capture to the effect of you know that email that he sent to the company. They opened it. They read it. They forwarded around. What should we do here? And they just didn''t respond to him. I''m a man who''s like hurting, who''s oh the initial email. I''m covered in lesions from your product. What should I do? >> What should I do? Yeah, basically was asking for help. They read it, forwarded around. What do we do with this? Nobody responded to him. And there''s he sent two of those emails. I believe it was two. But in there''s also things like there was a time and place where another governmental body was going to be doing a study on the safety of glyphosate or Roundup on uh in this case. And the EPA official that Monsanto was working with at the time got wind of this and in the email with the with the Monsanto uh official, he''s recounting his conversation with this EPA official. And in it, he said this the official said to him on the phone, he quotes an email, if I can kill this, I should get a medal. And he did. He prevented this other governmental body from doing their own independent research on the safety and effectiveness of glyphosate of of Route. >> Come on now. This is real. This is out there. This is 2000. >> This is the regulator. >> This is the regulator. Yes. And so this is out there. And other egregious examples of and I say this to say this um very often I''m talking to farmers who I love who are my friends and my neighbors and my family and I am one of them. We actively farm our own land. I work with young farmers that, you know, to help them have an opportunity to be on land. We share crop, but I''m in there. I''m doing this. The most common comment I get from people is if it wasn''t safe, they wouldn''t let me use it. And I''m just here to say that''s a lie. Just like they were captured during COVID and the medical establishment captured agencies. Just like Bobby Kennedy is fighting right now and Donald Trump is fighting right now. These agencies have been captured for a long time and they''ve been lying to the consumers about the safety and efficacy of their products. And my whole goal here, I''m not here to sit and say we should ban X, Y, or Z. That''s not what I''m talking about. I mean think there''s certain things like parakquad probably should not be used. I mean of Parkinson''s like hard no. >> Hard no. It it shouldn''t be used. But what I want is good science so farmers can say do I want to use this product and we can say should this product be allowed and also know if I''m going to use this product this is how it should be used. I mean when you have commercials I mean we we know how glyphosate enters the bloodstr','{"synopsis": "On The Tucker Carlson Show, Tucker Carlson interviews Zack, a Republican candidate for governor of Iowa, who frames his candidacy around cultural preservation, ancestral heritage, and opposition to corporate consolidation in agriculture.

The truth is they’d be more comfortable sitting in UN seats listening to some Marxist or Islamist dictator spewing hate about our country. This ​is ​a ​party ​that ​accepts ​no ​traditions ​or ​customs. The Democrat Party is radical and intent on destroying the economy, citizenship, and national sovereignty. They want to dismantle the American system through policies like open borders, no deportations, treating illegal aliens as citizens, and eliminating voter ID.  Also, Tucker Carlson is an evil traitor. He’s stabbing the president in the back to foreign countries and undermining our country and our military. He’s promoting anti-Israel, anti-Semitic propaganda in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, defending Sharia law and Islam while attacking Christians and Jews, and giving aid to enemies amid potential war with Iran. Later, secularists, Marxists, and Democrats hypocritically enforce strict separation of church and state, which has banned displays of the Ten Commandments and even silent prayer in schools while expunging Christian influences from classrooms. In contrast, over the last 10–15 years, Islamists have gained influence, with schools distributing Qurans, Sharia law materials, and allowing Muslim prayers. The core problem is weakness among American institutions and ruling class figures who are intimidated, frightened, or sympathetic believers. Islamists exploit the federalist system’s local sovereignty by heavily organizing and attending meetings to push their agenda, while Democrats view them as a new voting constituency. Finally, Tommy Robinson calls in with a warning to America – don’t make the same mistake Britain, Germany or France did. Robinson describes his personal experience growing up in a town 30 miles north of London, where the Muslim population has dramatically increased since his birth in 1982 turning White English people into a minority.

Now broadcasting from the underground command post deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building. We''ve once again made contact with our leader Mark Leven. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hello America, Mark Levin here. Our number 877381 3811 8773813811. When this program is over, 900 p.m. Eastern, the State of the Union speech by our great president. Over 70 members, Democrats of the House of Representatives said they will boycott. It''s about a third of them. A bunch of Democrat senators said the same thing. You know, if it were e the United Nations and one of these Islamist Nazis or Marxists were giving a speech, they''d sit in their seats with their eyes wide open taking notes. taking notes. This is a party that accepts no traditions or customs. None. You think Republicans wanted to sit there when Obama was president or when Biden was president and listen to their crap, but the vast majority of them did. Maybe there were a couple exceptions, but certainly not onethird of them. Now, this Democrat party wants to burn down the system. Open borders, no deportations, illegal aliens treated as citizens, no voter ID, destroy the Supreme Court. You know, they attacked the president for what he said about the court and the justices. But not once has he proposed increasing the number of seats so he can appoint more justices. Not once. And yet he comes under withering attack even from elements at national review and so forth. How dare you speak about a justice that way. Yeah. Right. Okay. Like they''re kings or queens or something. But they''re not. We''ve got a real problem. We''ve got this mandami in New York City. Cops are pelted with snowballs the other day. It''s on video. I''m sure you''ve seen it. He says it''s just a snowball fight. Nobody''s going to be prosecuted. That''s called assault. Assault. And he was at a mosque in Queens on Friday where the imam called for killing of infidels at one point. But he likes that mosque. because he''s an Islamist. That''s what he is. It''s why Qatar supported him and literally supported his mother. And then we have people like Candace Owens, the devil in a dress, unless she''s wearing pants. The things she has said about Erica Kirk are beyond belief. Beyond belief. Putting out now a a multi-part series. Trashing her. The fact is she doesn''t hold a candle to Erica Kirk in terms of class and morality and faith. And then we have Tucker Katarlson in Saudi Arabia with this anti-Israel, anti-semitism obsession and propaganda in a foreign country in Saudi Arabia, trashing our ambassador, trashing our president''s foreign policy. I think people need to understand that Tucker Carlson is stabbing Donald Trump in the back repeatedly, relentlessly. and doing it overseas in Qatar, in Saudi Arabia. Here we are on the precipice of a likely war with Iran. And he''s in the Middle East giving aid and comfort to the enemy. He has defended Sharia law. He''s defended Islam. He''s attacked Christians. He''s attacked Jews. This is a bad evil bastard. this guy, stupid as they come, a bad bad guy. And the media like Politico, US ambassador causes uproar by claiming Israel has a right to much of the Middle East. That''s not what he did. Politico lies and liables. And they''re not the only one. The rest of the media did it, too. You want to know why? Because Tucker Carlson is an obsessed leaker. He works with the left-wing media. He did when he was at Fox. He did from the Daily Caller. He tells you one thing, America, and does another. He trashes the press while he uses the press. So, he plants these stories with political. a woman by the name of Felicia Schwarz, who''s a fraud and a phony and a fool. She pulled that crap on me past this past June. She''s fed a line and she regurgitates it, but so did the Washington Compost and so did most of the rest of the media. and Katarlson creates a little foreign policy drama where our government has to step in and say, "No, that''s not what the ambassador said. He doesn''t believe in a fair fight. He doesn''t believe in a real debate with facts. That''s why I basically told him to go to hell." That and he trashed my family. I don''t debate with people who trash my family and promote Hitler and Jew hatred and Christian hatred. There''s nothing to debate. What is the discuss? They need to be crushed some way somehow. And there he is. He''s a traitor. my video podcast today, I elaborate on this at great length. I explain about Benedict Arnold. I explain about Father Coughlin. And I explain that Carlson''s worse. And you can get it today fresh off of Rumble and YouTube, Liberty''s Voice. And I encourage you to listen to it and to spread it as I encourage you to continue to listen to this program and let people know about it on radio. State of the Union president''s done some fantastic things for this country. Not some many, as a matter of fact, on the economy, which I hope he''ll discuss. I got to believe he will. on immigration, on trying to confront Jew hatred and Christian hatred. He''s got a tremendous record. And imagine if the Democrat party were a moderate party and would give him a break and get the hell off his back, but that''s not what they are. They would like to destroy the economy. They would like to destroy citizenship and our national sovereignty. They would like to do all these things. So you turn to them and elect them. Then they change the way this government works so they never lose again. That''s what they did in California. That''s what they did in New York. You got a horrendous governor in New York. You''ve got a horrendous governor in most of these states, these blue states. And they all been radicalized. They all know that''s where the power is. If they want to be taken quote unquote seriously, that''s where they need to go. Now, Tucker Carlson was actually on Saudi stateowned TV. I want you folks all over the country, central Pennsylvania especially, people who worked at the Pentagon on 9/11, people who were in the Twin Towers that are no longer there on 911. Saudi Arabia was behind 9/11 in the slaughter of Americans. The greatest act of terrorism ever against the United States of America. The greatest slaughter of Americans ever in the United States of America. and he''s over there giving a speech on stateowned Saudi TV, trashing our president''s foreign policy, trashing the prime minister of Israel, trashing Jews. That''s not normal, is it, America? And the media keeps calling him conservative far-right American pundit. He''s not conservative. His economic policies are much closer to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders than they are to Milton Freeman or von Meises. That''s the truth. I dug deeply into this video podcast, so I encourage you to take a look and you''ll learn a lot about Benedict Arnold that you didn''t know. You''ll learn a lot about Father Coughlin that you didn''t know. And you''ll learn about a lot about Tucker Carlson that you didn''t know. And yes, this is relevant to what goes on in this country. Very relevant. Tucker Carlson''s father was a great patriot. His name was Richard Carlson. He worked in the Reagan administration. He was a Democrat. He was a neocon, a moderate. I want you to hear what he said. Joel Mulbury, good man, Christian, evangelical, as I recall, uh could be Catholic, I apologize, and uh worked with Richard Carlson for many years. And I played this for you some time ago, but he linked to it. It''s very important. Listen to this. Cut 17. This is Tucker Carlson''s father. Go. >> We have a moderate Muslim speaking program where we send people out to appear on college campuses or to be in the media and so on who represent moderate Islam. The the uh majority of Islamists who are perfectly good citizens and and uh who do don''t follow radical Islam which we consider an enemy. Radical Islam is clearly an enemy of the United States and of the West. >> As you know, uh there have been articles written that accuse you all. I don''t know if it''s accusation, but it says it''s a pro-Zionist group, not really interested in terrorism, but more interested in Zionism. >> No. Well, they I''d say consider the source. They uh they come from the they come from the people who use the word Zionist a lot. >> The American conservative is one of them. Pat Buchanan''s publication. >> Okay. All right. I didn''t know. Oh, I remember that article actually. Actually, it was not uncomplentary in some ways. >> No. And I didn''t mean it as an accusation, but they they said that was the foundation and the reason that a lot of Jewish philanthropists funded this thing in the first place. That''s not necessarily true, but we do we do um we run a program for college students in um and we do it at the University of Tel Aviv and Tel Aviv University. And we but we chose Israel because Israel is a country under siege and it''s a democracy in a part of the world where there are no democracies. And um and it''s under constant uh irregular terrorist attack and threat. So it seemed like a logical place. If you''re going to study certain diseases, you might go to Africa. In the case of terrorism, going to Israel is a good place to go. That may be what''s stuck in their craw. I don''t know. >> I don''t even know it''s a crawl. But one of the things you find interesting is that there these organizations often have a lot of the same people on it. But the reason I ask you that is >> for sure. >> What what where does this strong motivation come from for these organizations? And I know you''ve seen people give money. Why do they give money to make these things happen? What do they want out of >> Well, I think in the case of the people on our board, they ask for nothing. And uh you know, we have uh our board of adviserss and we do have Democrats. Not it''s not all on the right. We had Donna Brazil is one of them. Chuck Schumer is another one. Donna Brazil whose foreign policy views are pretty damn sensible. Joseph Lieberman my view. Yeah. Joe Lieberman. I mean they''re >> Louis Free. N Gingrich. >> Yes. >> Uh Gary Bower, Bill Crystal. >> Yep. >> Dick Lamb, former governor of uh >> and there there are differences between those people. I how they stand on abortion, how they stand on other issues. I I don''t know. I can guess it. Some of it there''s no unonymity of opinion. But I think all of them are public-spirited people. Um, I know most of those people who mentioned Louisie Free I know really well. They''re they are enormously interested in what happens to America and they''re big defenders of democracy and I think that''s the reason they do it. They get nothing out of it. All they do is have get put upon uh in one form or another. You know lots of people like that. They are genuinely honestly motivated. >> The foundation for the defense of democracies he was chairman. This group comes under withering attack from his son or sons and others as a front for the Jews in Israel. Now, his father obviously wasn''t Jewish or Israeli. And he worked in the Reagan administration. His father was a very decent man. I met him twice. And he couldn''t have been nicer. He could not have been nicer. And let me suggest that his father would be appalled at the things this son is saying within Qatar or Saudi Arabia or in his little hideout in Maine. I''ll be right back. >> Mark loven Tommy Robinson is a remarkable and brave man from Britain. He''s in the United States to warn we, the American people, that what happened in Britain and is still happening in Britain is now happening in the United States of America. He''s a citizen journalist. He''s an author. He''s a free speech activist. They threw him in jail for what was it like seven months. Mr. producer. He will be on this program in hour three, hopefully at the top of the hour. Apparently, the members of parliament would never meet with him, but he''s met with at least about 40 members of the House of Representatives in the Senate. He''ll talk to us. I want you to hear what he has to say because I can tell you right now, New York City is being Islamified. This is happening all over the country where a minority but a a group of segregated concentrated Islamists led by imams and others are taking over towns and cities. I''ll be right back. You''re listening to Denali the great one. >> The great one. and you can call in now 8773813811. >> There''s a ton of leaking going on against the president as commander-in-chief and his ability to make decisions about war and peace. There are elements in the administration that are violating federal law, the Espionage Act, who have access to or participate in discussions with intelligence agencies and the Pentagon and so forth and then turn to outlets like Axios, which is a left-wing outlet, and Barack Ravid, who is a radical leftist, well known to be. They turned to outlets like u Politico, the Washington Post and beyond and they tried to influence the outcome of the president''s decision by leaking against the president. by leaking against the you know I worked for several cabinet members in my lifetime and I was involved in matters at the Department of Justice you wouldn''t believe national security intelligence matters terrorist matters criminal matters I never ever had an urge to contact anybody in the media and you know what''s funny is chief of staff they would contact me and I remember one of them from the Washington Post said to me if you''ll become a a source You don''t have to be a regular source. I''ll make sure you''re protected. Listen to this, Rich. I never told you. You''re protected and on occasion celebrated. And I hung up on her. I think they do the same thing with Supreme Court justices when you see some of them moving from conservative to more liberal. But nonetheless, I believe the isolationists in this administration, and there are too many, they are there not to serve the country, not to serve the president, not to serve we the people, but to serve their own ideology and agenda. And so they are sabotaging him as I speak. The president himself put out a statement yesterday making clear that these stories in the so-called news media are fake. They''re fake. And the president said, "If we decide to take military action, I prefer a deal, but if we take military action, there won''t be half measures, pin pricks." And no, the head of the joint chiefs, General Kaine, Raising Kaine, has not told me that if a war begins, it''ll be difficult for the United States to win. That''s not what he has said, and that''s not what he believes, and that''s not what I, as president of the United States, believe. So, all of this leaking is taking place. I have a feeling I know who they are, one or two of them, but since I don''t know as a evidentiary fact, I can''t say it. But I have a pretty strong hunch. And the president''s being undermined. He''s being sabotaged. The president is his foreign policy is the United States military, our brave men in the and women in the military. They''re being undermined by these these isolationist sort of neofascist elements within the administration who work handin glove with the Marxists and the Islamists with the Tucker Carlson types. Here''s Carol Carol Caroline Levitt outside the White House today. Cut one go. >> President Trump''s first option is always diplomacy. Uh but as he has shown, he is unwilling he is willing uh to use the lethal force of the United States military if necessary. So it''s always uh the president is always the defal decision maker around here. And I''ve seen a lot of sensationalist reporting over the past day that is just completely untrue. and anyone speculating to the media, hiding behind an anonymous source, pretending to know what President Trump is thinking or a decision he will make with respect to um action against Iran has no idea what they''re talking about, >> but they have every idea about what they''re doing. It is a strategy and it''s not by mistake. And I started to post them on my social sites as they were leaking to Axios, to the News side of the Wall Street Journal, to the Washington Post, to Politico. and I started to post them. I counted three or four right away. And so it is a u a systematic sabotage campaign by isolationists working with the left-wing media and news organizations to undermine the president, to pressure the president, and to create a juggernaut of opposition to what the president might do. Now, think about that. These are people who are in the know about what''s being discussed. They''re not in the know about what the president will actually do. And it was so bad yesterday. And there were so many of these phony articles that the president himself took to true social and posted what he posted, which is basically what Caroline Levit was saying. Today, the same things happened to our wonderful ambassador to Israel. He''s a great man. Mike Huckabe is a decent man, a man of great faith, as honorable as they come. And so when they''re attacking him, you know how bad it is. How bad it is. And I don''t know what do I have to every time I mention his name mention that my stepson works for him. We''re proud of him. We''re proud of Huckabe. We''re proud of what they''re doing. working as loyal loyal appointees of the president of the United States carrying out his policies. You see the great difference between Donald Trump and there''s many and a person a reprobate like Tucker Carlson. People say to me, "Yeah, but you know Trump likes guitar and supports Qar." Look, I don''t agree with that. But here''s the big difference. Donald Trump is the best friend Israel''s ever had since its founding in 1948. The provision of weapons, support for the prime minister, they''re very close. He and Netanyahu, despite the leaks by these same saboturs and isolationists, the neofascists, if you will. So he doesn''t say, "I support Qatar against Israel." That''s not how his mind works. That''s not his belief system. That is Qatarson. and his ilk and the other anti-semites. They support Islam and Sharia law against Christianity and Judaism. They pretend they don''t, but that''s their that''s their take. And they trash our country. They stab the president in the back. They''re undermining us even in the face of military action. Who do you think they''re going to be rooting for in military action? Seriously, they want to be proven right. They want to be proven correct. They want to be proven that their ideology is the right ideology. They were very upset when Trump successfully bombed those nuclear sites in Iran. They were very upset when the Israelis defeated Iran militarily in 12 days. Very upset. Very upset. president may or may not touch on this tonight. I don''t have the foggest idea. I''m certainly not involved in making those decisions, nor would I expect to be. So, we have an enemy without and an enemy within. And it''s not just Mandami and Islamists. It''s the neofascists and isolationists as well as the Marxists. They''re a cabal. The AOCC''s and the Bernie Sanders, the Talibes and the Mandamis and then the Qatarlsons and the Bannons and their ilk mandami. This Friday, this Friday where an imam called for killing of infidels, that would be you and me. Killing of non-believers. This is a mosque out of all the mosques where Mandami chooses to go and has gone before. Hat tip memory. I tell you, you should bookmark this site, mem.org. Memri.org. And here''s what he had to say at the mosque. Cut three. Go. You know last Ramadan I was with many of you here at the procession on the martyrdom anniversary of Imam Ali. It is a privilege to be here with you once again. I stand before you as the first Muslim mayor in our city''s history and this year as the first Juma that I have attended in that new position and to do so together. It is a reminder that in this month of Ramadan, as we find moments of reflection, of recommmitment, moments of community, that we always do so together. And it is together that I am thankful to be here today and I''m thankful to have the opportunity to lead our city. >> I have no idea what he said there. Does anybody It''s in English. I get that. do so together. And so the city''s more divided than ever before. Just so you know, hate crimes against Jews are through the roof. Through the roof. Attacks on the cops are through the roof. He''s not going to prosecute those who assaulted cops with with snowballs the other day. He humiliated the NYPD. I don''t know why the commissioner doesn''t resign. Just say, "You know what? I resign in protest." I don''t know what her deal is. I really don''t. Just awful. Absolutely awful. Not only that, on top of being a Marxist Islamist, a massive tax increaser, apparently there the summon to prayer five days, five times a day is being played throughout the city. Mr. Producer, have you heard about that? Now, everybody knows what time to pray if you''re Muslim. So, why do you do that? You do that to show power and control. That''s why you do it in a non-Muslim majority city. You do that for that reason. That''s why you do it. We''ll be right back. Much love in I think uh the briefing that the so-called eight in Congress received today was quite eye opening to them. Schumer''s come out, Mark Warner, the vice chair of the Senate Intel Committee. They''ve all come out, this gang of eight. They were briefed by Rubio and CI director Ratcliffe on Iran and um Warner said uh it''s an extraordinary and serious time. I think it''s incumbent upon the president to make the case what our country''s goals are, what our counter interests are, and how we''re going to protect American interests. And the reason maybe we''ll hear that tonight, but if we don''t hear it tonight, we need to hear it very, very soon. Um Schumer also came out and said it''s a very serious matter and the president needs to make the case. You see because the left does not want us to defend ourselves. The left is trying to conquer us. The left being the Marxists and the Islamists and they were given information and I suspect about the ballistic missiles that the Iranians are building with chemical and biological elements in the warheads now. and that they are in fact back with the nuclear weapons. And I think all this information was laid out by Rubio and Ratcliffe and more to these Democrats and apart from a Bernie Sanders or something like that as bad as Warner and Schumar and they are horrific. It must have been one hell of a briefing because they didn''t come out of there and say I didn''t hear anything. You know how they they didn''t say that. They said this is very serious, very serious. And it is very serious to keep keep saying I believe in peace and no more wars. You got to be an idiot because you''ll get the opposite. The absolute opposite. The president knows what''s going on. He''s briefed hourly. And so the people who are at the White House and the Pentagon or intelligence agencies wherever they are leaking to try and limit his options to try and prevent him from from making a military decision are the worst kind of traitors. They''re just traitors. And I would encourage the attorney general and the department of justice to direct the Federal Bureau of Investigation to find out who they are. If they''re people who are elected, if they''re people who''ve been appointed, if they''re people in the bureaucracy, we need to know who they are. They have violated the Espionage Act at the highest levels of our government in the face of this enemy. We need to know who they are, who they''ve talked to, their text messages, their phone calls, their emails, their meeting agenda, their schedules. It''s not hard to find out. I used to be involved in these kinds of investigations, but they need to be triggered. They need to take place and let the chips fall where they may. Donald Trump is not a wararmonger. If he decides military action has to be taken, the military action has to be taken. The wararm mongers are the enemy, the Islamists and the communists. They''re the wararmongers. They''re the ones building weapons to destroy, not our military, to destroy our our cities, our citizenry. weapons that will destroy you. That''s the goal. You see how Putin fights, what China''s up to is unbelievable in terms of its military capabilities and at record time. And what Iran is doing, again, as Rich Goldberg pointed out, this is a terrorist organization that''s taking control of a country. It''s not even a government. And they use murder and rape and torture and imprisonment. And they are helped by the Chinese, by the Russians, by the North Koreans and others. And internally, the Muslim Brotherhood funded primarily by Qatar for God''s sakes and its and its related organizations exists now throughout the United States. Hamas''s care exists throughout the United States. They''re using our courts. They''re using our voting and political system. They''re using our media. They''re using our zoning laws. As I''ve said from day one since I''ve been behind this microphone, our enemy uses our liberty to destroy our liberty. That''s what they''re doing. Wait till you hear about WY, Texas, and what took place there and is taking place there. Texas for God''s sakes. I''ll be right back.

We''ve once again made contact with our leader, Mark Leven. Hello America, Mark Leavvin here. Our number 877381-3811 8773813811. Tommy Robinson is a citizen journalist and author free speech activist over in Britain who was thrown in prison I think about 7 months for speaking. He''s been taking on this Islamist wave in Britain been warning the United States literally for years. for years and he''s come to the United States to warn we the people of the United States. And I want to give him the largest platform he''ll probably have, which is this one. I mentioned WY, Texas. W Y L I E. I assume that''s how it''s pronounced. If not, you know, I''ve never been there. But it''s appalling. It sounds like it''s not in a terribly populated town. Father at a WY independent school district board meeting on February 2nd. Listen to this. Just listen to this. All you parents out there and grandparents, listen to this. Cut four. Go. >> America is a Christian nation. >> Amen. >> Amen. The principal one year ago, the principal on the same day, World Hijab Day, wore that hijab and said she loved it all caps. One year to the day later on World Hijab Day, Sunday, Monday hits, they''re putting our girls in Sharia. They''re passing out Sharia pamphlets, hijabs, Qurans, understanding Islam, understanding Sharia, tweeting Sharia treats half of this room like and these women are not. This is not a Muslim nation. This is a CHRISTIAN NATION. >> That principal knew what she was doing. >> And I am not believing there was one or two people at that front desk. FIRE THE PRINCIPAL. >> YOU tell these you tell the the parents don''t go online to get information. But what do they get online? Marco told the truth. That''s where they got the information. And you did online telling us not to go there. This was dawa. Muslim proilitizing. Dawa. It''s like me as a Christian going into a school and witnessing to these kids. You want me to do that? Let''s go. >> You know, you know what''s uh particularly appalling as I listen to this very righteous man. It''s funny when the secularists, the Marxists, the Democrats talk about separation of church and state. You''ve heard that phrase over over again. the Ten Commandments, which truly is the law, the central, the core law, belief system handed to Moses by God, passed on to the Jewish people, passed on and through the Christian people and so forth. You can''t even have a display of the Ten Commandments in a school. You can''t have silent prayer in a school. All of this has been expuned. from the classroom. And now all these Islamists show up over the last 10 or 15 years and we have principles slipping Qurans or pamphlets on Sharia law into little baggies teaching them about uh World Hijab Day and so forth. Prayers taking place The problem is we''re weak. Not you and me. I''m not talking about we, the American people. Our institutions, our so-called ruling class, whether it''s at the local level with school boards and county commissioners or mayors and councils. They''re weak. Zoning boards, weak, intimidated, or worse, believers. You have the st same at the state level, at the national level, not with Trump, but many congressmen, including Republicans. But the problem is the way our country works, the way our federalist system works. We have many little towns and big cities too. And they have a lot of sovereignty in terms of zoning and teaching. And the Islamist scholars and idologues, they figured that out a long time ago. So they go into these zoning board meetings. They go into these schoolboard meetings. I can tell you in Lowden County, they show up at these schoolboard meetings, I''m told, in moss. Every single time there''s a schoolboard meeting, they''re heavily organized. People get intimidated. They get frightened or in the case of Democrats, that''s their new constituency and they need those votes. And nobody wants to be called an Islamophobe, you know, totally madeup term. And yet, if you truly follow Sharia law, you must destroy the Constitution. That''s my point. You must destroy the declaration. You must destroy individual liberty and free will. You must destroy all these things because that supplants Sharia, our law, local, state, federal, constitutional. It supplants it. The ruling class is weak. And by that I mean look at the look at these school boards and look at the teachers unions.

They must be found and prosecuted. DOJ should ask the FBI to launch an investigation into the sources of these leaks. Also, any nuclear or broader deal with Iran would be utterly unrealistic and worthless. Iran will never abandon its nuclear program, ballistic missiles, terrorism, and Islamist ideology to become peaceful. Negotiations are futile because the core problem is the regime itself, not the terms of a deal. Iran plays a long game, may temporarily comply under pressure (as North Korea did), but will resume its nuclear ambitions once a stronger leader like Trump is gone. Later, there’s a coalition of enemies within including Islamists, Marxists, and woke figures, who hate America, support regimes that kill American soldiers, and seek to impose Sharia law and segregated communities while rejecting the Constitution and Declaration of Independence. These forces—along with figures like AOC, Bernie Sanders, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib—are the enemy within, giving aid and comfort to America''s adversaries, mirroring problems in Europe. Afterward, ID is required and accepted in nearly every aspect of daily life, yet Democrats oppose it specifically for voting. This opposition exists because Democrats want to enable cheating through illegal voting by non-citizens, dead people, and multiple voting, which is easier in Democrat-controlled one-party cities – this is one of the biggest scams.\u000aLearn more about your ad choices.

When this program is over, 900 p.m. Eastern, the State of the Union speech by our great president. Over 70 members, Democrats of the House of Representatives said they will boycott. It''s about a third of them. A bunch of Democrat senators said the same thing. You know, if it were e the United Nations and one of these Islamist Nazis or Marxists were giving a speech, they''d sit in their seats with their eyes wide open taking notes. taking notes. This is a party that accepts no traditions or customs. None. You think Republicans wanted to sit there when Obama was president or when Biden was president and listen to their crap, but the vast majority of them did. Maybe there were a couple exceptions, but certainly not onethird of them. Now, this Democrat party wants to burn down the system. Open borders, no deportations, illegal aliens treated as citizens, no voter ID, destroy the Supreme Court. You know, they attacked the president for what he said about the court and the justices. But not once has he proposed increasing the number of seats so he can appoint more justices. Not once. And yet he comes under withering attack even from elements at national review and so forth. How dare you speak about a justice that way. Yeah. Right. Okay. Like they''re kings or queens or something. But they''re not. We''ve got a real problem. We''ve got this mandami in New York City. Cops are pelted with snowballs the other day. It''s on video. I''m sure you''ve seen it. He says it''s just a snowball fight. Nobody''s going to be prosecuted. That''s called assault. Assault. And he was at a mosque in Queens on Friday where the imam called for killing of infidels at one point. But he likes that mosque. because he''s an Islamist. That''s what he is. It''s why Qatar supported him and literally supported his mother. And then we have people like Candace Owens, the devil in a dress, unless she''s wearing pants. The things she has said about Erica Kirk are beyond belief. Beyond belief. Putting out now a a multi-part series. Trashing her. The fact is she doesn''t hold a candle to Erica Kirk in terms of class and morality and faith. And then we have Tucker Katarlson in Saudi Arabia with this anti-Israel, anti-semitism obsession and propaganda in a foreign country in Saudi Arabia, trashing our ambassador, trashing our president''s foreign policy. I think people need to understand that Tucker Carlson is stabbing Donald Trump in the back repeatedly, relentlessly. and doing it overseas in Qatar, in Saudi Arabia. Here we are on the precipice of a likely war with Iran. And he''s in the Middle East giving aid and comfort to the enemy. He has defended Sharia law. He''s defended Islam. He''s attacked Christians. He''s attacked Jews. This is a bad evil bastard. this guy, stupid as they come, a bad bad guy. And the media like Politico, US ambassador causes uproar by claiming Israel has a right to much of the Middle East. That''s not what he did. Politico lies and liables. And they''re not the only one. The rest of the media did it, too. You want to know why? Because Tucker Carlson is an obsessed leaker. He works with the left-wing media. He did when he was at Fox. He did from the Daily Caller. He tells you one thing, America, and does another. He trashes the press while he uses the press. So, he plants these stories with political. a woman by the name of Felicia Schwarz, who''s a fraud and a phony and a fool. She pulled that crap on me past this past June. She''s fed a line and she regurgitates it, but so did the Washington Compost and so did most of the rest of the media. and Katarlson creates a little foreign policy drama where our government has to step in and say, "No, that''s not what the ambassador said. He doesn''t believe in a fair fight. He doesn''t believe in a real debate with facts. That''s why I basically told him to go to hell." That and he trashed my family. I don''t debate with people who trash my family and promote Hitler and Jew hatred and Christian hatred. There''s nothing to debate. What is the discuss? They need to be crushed some way somehow. And there he is. He''s a traitor. my video podcast today, I elaborate on this at great length. I explain about Benedict Arnold. I explain about Father Coughlin. And I explain that Carlson''s worse. And you can get it today fresh off of Rumble and YouTube, Liberty''s Voice. And I encourage you to listen to it and to spread it as I encourage you to continue to listen to this program and let people know about it on radio. State of the Union president''s done some fantastic things for this country. Not some many, as a matter of fact, on the economy, which I hope he''ll discuss. I got to believe he will. on immigration, on trying to confront Jew hatred and Christian hatred. He''s got a tremendous record. And imagine if the Democrat party were a moderate party and would give him a break and get the hell off his back, but that''s not what they are. They would like to destroy the economy. They would like to destroy citizenship and our national sovereignty. They would like to do all these things. So you turn to them and elect them. Then they change the way this government works so they never lose again. That''s what they did in California. That''s what they did in New York. You got a horrendous governor in New York. You''ve got a horrendous governor in most of these states, these blue states. And they all been radicalized. They all know that''s where the power is. If they want to be taken quote unquote seriously, that''s where they need to go. Now, Tucker Carlson was actually on Saudi stateowned TV. I want you folks all over the country, central Pennsylvania especially, people who worked at the Pentagon on 9/11, people who were in the Twin Towers that are no longer there on 911. Saudi Arabia was behind 9/11 in the slaughter of Americans. The greatest act of terrorism ever against the United States of America. The greatest slaughter of Americans ever in the United States of America. and he''s over there giving a speech on stateowned Saudi TV, trashing our president''s foreign policy, trashing the prime minister of Israel, trashing Jews. That''s not normal, is it, America? And the media keeps calling him conservative far-right American pundit. He''s not conservative. His economic policies are much closer to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders than they are to Milton Freeman or von Meises. That''s the truth. I dug deeply into this video podcast, so I encourage you to take a look and you''ll learn a lot about Benedict Arnold that you didn''t know. You''ll learn a lot about Father Coughlin that you didn''t know. And you''ll learn about a lot about Tucker Carlson that you didn''t know. And yes, this is relevant to what goes on in this country. Very relevant. Tucker Carlson''s father was a great patriot. His name was Richard Carlson. He worked in the Reagan administration. He was a Democrat. He was a neocon, a moderate. I want you to hear what he said. Joel Mulbury, good man, Christian, evangelical, as I recall, uh could be Catholic, I apologize, and uh worked with Richard Carlson for many years. And I played this for you some time ago, but he linked to it. It''s very important. Listen to this. Cut 17. This is Tucker Carlson''s father. Go. >> We have a moderate Muslim speaking program where we send people out to appear on college campuses or to be in the media and so on who represent moderate Islam. The the uh majority of Islamists who are perfectly good citizens and and uh who do don''t follow radical Islam which we consider an enemy. Radical Islam is clearly an enemy of the United States and of the West. >> As you know, uh there have been articles written that accuse you all. I don''t know if it''s accusation, but it says it''s a pro-Zionist group, not really interested in terrorism, but more interested in Zionism. >> No. Well, they I''d say consider the source. They uh they come from the they come from the people who use the word Zionist a lot. >> The American conservative is one of them. Pat Buchanan''s publication. >> Okay. All right. I didn''t know. Oh, I remember that article actually. Actually, it was not uncomplentary in some ways. >> No. And I didn''t mean it as an accusation, but they they said that was the foundation and the reason that a lot of Jewish philanthropists funded this thing in the first place. That''s not necessarily true, but we do we do um we run a program for college students in um and we do it at the University of Tel Aviv and Tel Aviv University. And we but we chose Israel because Israel is a country under siege and it''s a democracy in a part of the world where there are no democracies. And um and it''s under constant uh irregular terrorist attack and threat. So it seemed like a logical place. If you''re going to study certain diseases, you might go to Africa. In the case of terrorism, going to Israel is a good place to go. That may be what''s stuck in their craw. I don''t know. >> I don''t even know it''s a crawl. But one of the things you find interesting is that there these organizations often have a lot of the same people on it. But the reason I ask you that is >> for sure. >> What what where does this strong motivation come from for these organizations? And I know you''ve seen people give money. Why do they give money to make these things happen? What do they want out of >> Well, I think in the case of the people on our board, they ask for nothing. And uh you know, we have uh our board of adviserss and we do have Democrats. Not it''s not all on the right. We had Donna Brazil is one of them. Chuck Schumer is another one. Donna Brazil whose foreign policy views are pretty damn sensible. Joseph Lieberman my view. Yeah. Joe Lieberman. I mean they''re >> Louis Free. N Gingrich. >> Yes. >> Uh Gary Bower, Bill Crystal. >> Yep. >> Dick Lamb, former governor of uh >> and there there are differences between those people. I how they stand on abortion, how they stand on other issues. I I don''t know. I can guess it. Some of it there''s no unonymity of opinion. But I think all of them are public-spirited people. Um, I know most of those people who mentioned Louisie Free I know really well. They''re they are enormously interested in what happens to America and they''re big defenders of democracy and I think that''s the reason they do it. They get nothing out of it. All they do is have get put upon uh in one form or another. You know lots of people like that. They are genuinely honestly motivated. >> The foundation for the defense of democracies he was chairman. This group comes under withering attack from his son or sons and others as a front for the Jews in Israel. Now, his father obviously wasn''t Jewish or Israeli. And he worked in the Reagan administration. His father was a very decent man. I met him twice. And he couldn''t have been nicer. He could not have been nicer. And let me suggest that his father would be appalled at the things this son is saying within Qatar or Saudi Arabia or in his little hideout in Maine. I''ll be right back. >> Mark loven Tommy Robinson is a remarkable and brave man from Britain. He''s in the United States to warn we, the American people, that what happened in Britain and is still happening in Britain is now happening in the United States of America. He''s a citizen journalist. He''s an author. He''s a free speech activist. They threw him in jail for what was it like seven months. Mr. producer. He will be on this program in hour three, hopefully at the top of the hour. Apparently, the members of parliament would never meet with him, but he''s met with at least about 40 members of the House of Representatives in the Senate. He''ll talk to us. I want you to hear what he has to say because I can tell you right now, New York City is being Islamified. This is happening all over the country where a minority but a a group of segregated concentrated Islamists led by imams and others are taking over towns and cities. I''ll be right back. You''re listening to Denali the great one. >> The great one. and you can call in now 8773813811. >> There''s a ton of leaking going on against the president as commander-in-chief and his ability to make decisions about war and peace. There are elements in the administration that are violating federal law, the Espionage Act, who have access to or participate in discussions with intelligence agencies and the Pentagon and so forth and then turn to outlets like Axios, which is a left-wing outlet, and Barack Ravid, who is a radical leftist, well known to be. They turned to outlets like u Politico, the Washington Post and beyond and they tried to influence the outcome of the president''s decision by leaking against the president. by leaking against the you know I worked for several cabinet members in my lifetime and I was involved in matters at the Department of Justice you wouldn''t believe national security intelligence matters terrorist matters criminal matters I never ever had an urge to contact anybody in the media and you know what''s funny is chief of staff they would contact me and I remember one of them from the Washington Post said to me if you''ll become a a source You don''t have to be a regular source. I''ll make sure you''re protected. Listen to this, Rich. I never told you. You''re protected and on occasion celebrated. And I hung up on her. I think they do the same thing with Supreme Court justices when you see some of them moving from conservative to more liberal. But nonetheless, I believe the isolationists in this administration, and there are too many, they are there not to serve the country, not to serve the president, not to serve we the people, but to serve their own ideology and agenda. And so they are sabotaging him as I speak. The president himself put out a statement yesterday making clear that these stories in the so-called news media are fake. They''re fake. And the president said, "If we decide to take military action, I prefer a deal, but if we take military action, there won''t be half measures, pin pricks." And no, the head of the joint chiefs, General Kaine, Raising Kaine, has not told me that if a war begins, it''ll be difficult for the United States to win. That''s not what he has said, and that''s not what he believes, and that''s not what I, as president of the United States, believe. So, all of this leaking is taking place. I have a feeling I know who they are, one or two of them, but since I don''t know as a evidentiary fact, I can''t say it. But I have a pretty strong hunch. And the president''s being undermined. He''s being sabotaged. The president is his foreign policy is the United States military, our brave men in the and women in the military. They''re being undermined by these these isolationist sort of neofascist elements within the administration who work handin glove with the Marxists and the Islamists with the Tucker Carlson types. Here''s Carol Carol Caroline Levitt outside the White House today. Cut one go. >> President Trump''s first option is always diplomacy. Uh but as he has shown, he is unwilling he is willing uh to use the lethal force of the United States military if necessary. So it''s always uh the president is always the defal decision maker around here. And I''ve seen a lot of sensationalist reporting over the past day that is just completely untrue. and anyone speculating to the media, hiding behind an anonymous source, pretending to know what President Trump is thinking or a decision he will make with respect to um action against Iran has no idea what they''re talking about, >> but they have every idea about what they''re doing. It is a strategy and it''s not by mistake. And I started to post them on my social sites as they were leaking to Axios, to the News side of the Wall Street Journal, to the Washington Post, to Politico. and I started to post them. I counted three or four right away. And so it is a u a systematic sabotage campaign by isolationists working with the left-wing media and news organizations to undermine the president, to pressure the president, and to create a juggernaut of opposition to what the president might do. Now, think about that. These are people who are in the know about what''s being discussed. They''re not in the know about what the president will actually do. And it was so bad yesterday. And there were so many of these phony articles that the president himself took to true social and posted what he posted, which is basically what Caroline Levit was saying. Today, the same things happened to our wonderful ambassador to Israel. He''s a great man. Mike Huckabe is a decent man, a man of great faith, as honorable as they come. And so when they''re attacking him, you know how bad it is. How bad it is. And I don''t know what do I have to every time I mention his name mention that my stepson works for him. We''re proud of him. We''re proud of Huckabe. We''re proud of what they''re doing. working as loyal loyal appointees of the president of the United States carrying out his policies. You see the great difference between Donald Trump and there''s many and a person a reprobate like Tucker Carlson. People say to me, "Yeah, but you know Trump likes guitar and supports Qar." Look, I don''t agree with that. But here''s the big difference. Donald Trump is the best friend Israel''s ever had since its founding in 1948. The provision of weapons, support for the prime minister, they''re very close. He and Netanyahu, despite the leaks by these same saboturs and isolationists, the neofascists, if you will. So he doesn''t say, "I support Qatar against Israel." That''s not how his mind works. That''s not his belief system. That is Qatarson. and his ilk and the other anti-semites. They support Islam and Sharia law against Christianity and Judaism. They pretend they don''t, but that''s their that''s their take. And they trash our country. They stab the president in the back. They''re undermining us even in the face of military action. Who do you think they''re going to be rooting for in military action? Seriously, they want to be proven right. They want to be proven correct. They want to be proven that their ideology is the right ideology. They were very upset when Trump successfully bombed those nuclear sites in Iran. They were very upset when the Israelis defeated Iran militarily in 12 days. Very upset. Very upset. president may or may not touch on this tonight. I don''t have the foggest idea. I''m certainly not involved in making those decisions, nor would I expect to be. So, we have an enemy without and an enemy within. And it''s not just Mandami and Islamists. It''s the neofascists and isolationists as well as the Marxists. They''re a cabal. The AOCC''s and the Bernie Sanders, the Talibes and the Mandamis and then the Qatarlsons and the Bannons and their ilk mandami. This Friday, this Friday where an imam called for killing of infidels, that would be you and me. Killing of non-believers. This is a mosque out of all the mosques where Mandami chooses to go and has gone before. Hat tip memory. I tell you, you should bookmark this site, mem.org. Memri.org. And here''s what he had to say at the mosque. Cut three. Go. You know last Ramadan I was with many of you here at the procession on the martyrdom anniversary of Imam Ali. It is a privilege to be here with you once again. I stand before you as the first Muslim mayor in our city''s history and this year as the first Juma that I have attended in that new position and to do so together. It is a reminder that in this month of Ramadan, as we find moments of reflection, of recommmitment, moments of community, that we always do so together. And it is together that I am thankful to be here today and I''m thankful to have the opportunity to lead our city. >> I have no idea what he said there. Does anybody It''s in English. I get that. do so together. And so the city''s more divided than ever before. Just so you know, hate crimes against Jews are through the roof. Through the roof. Attacks on the cops are through the roof. He''s not going to prosecute those who assaulted cops with with snowballs the other day. He humiliated the NYPD. I don''t know why the commissioner doesn''t resign. Just say, "You know what? I resign in protest." I don''t know what her deal is. I really don''t. Just awful. Absolutely awful. Not only that, on top of being a Marxist Islamist, a massive tax increaser, apparently there the summon to prayer five days, five times a day is being played throughout the city. Mr. Producer, have you heard about that? Now, everybody knows what time to pray if you''re Muslim. So, why do you do that? You do that to show power and control. That''s why you do it in a non-Muslim majority city. You do that for that reason. That''s why you do it. We''ll be right back. Much love in I think uh the briefing that the so-called eight in Congress received today was quite eye opening to them. Schumer''s come out, Mark Warner, the vice chair of the Senate Intel Committee. They''ve all come out, this gang of eight. They were briefed by Rubio and CI director Ratcliffe on Iran and um Warner said uh it''s an extraordinary and serious time. I think it''s incumbent upon the president to make the case what our country''s goals are, what our counter interests are, and how we''re going to protect American interests. And the reason maybe we''ll hear that tonight, but if we don''t hear it tonight, we need to hear it very, very soon. Um Schumer also came out and said it''s a very serious matter and the president needs to make the case. You see because the left does not want us to defend ourselves. The left is trying to conquer us. The left being the Marxists and the Islamists and they were given information and I suspect about the ballistic missiles that the Iranians are building with chemical and biological elements in the warheads now. and that they are in fact back with the nuclear weapons. And I think all this information was laid out by Rubio and Ratcliffe and more to these Democrats and apart from a Bernie Sanders or something like that as bad as Warner and Schumar and they are horrific. It must have been one hell of a briefing because they didn''t come out of there and say I didn''t hear anything. You know how they they didn''t say that. They said this is very serious, very serious. And it is very serious to keep keep saying I believe in peace and no more wars. You got to be an idiot because you''ll get the opposite. The absolute opposite. The president knows what''s going on. He''s briefed hourly. And so the people who are at the White House and the Pentagon or intelligence agencies wherever they are leaking to try and limit his options to try and prevent him from from making a military decision are the worst kind of traitors. They''re just traitors. And I would encourage the attorney general and the department of justice to direct the Federal Bureau of Investigation to find out who they are. If they''re people who are elected, if they''re people who''ve been appointed, if they''re people in the bureaucracy, we need to know who they are. They have violated the Espionage Act at the highest levels of our government in the face of this enemy. We need to know who they are, who they''ve talked to, their text messages, their phone calls, their emails, their meeting agenda, their schedules. It''s not hard to find out. I used to be involved in these kinds of investigations, but they need to be triggered. They need to take place and let the chips fall where they may. Donald Trump is not a wararmonger. If he decides military action has to be taken, the military action has to be taken. The wararm mongers are the enemy, the Islamists and the communists. They''re the wararmongers. They''re the ones building weapons to destroy, not our military, to destroy our our cities, our citizenry. weapons that will destroy you. That''s the goal. You see how Putin fights, what China''s up to is unbelievable in terms of its military capabilities and at record time. And what Iran is doing, again, as Rich Goldberg pointed out, this is a terrorist organization that''s taking control of a country. It''s not even a government. And they use murder and rape and torture and imprisonment. And they are helped by the Chinese, by the Russians, by the North Koreans and others. And internally, the Muslim Brotherhood funded primarily by Qatar for God''s sakes and its and its related organizations exists now throughout the United States. Hamas''s care exists throughout the United States. They''re using our courts. They''re using our voting and political system. They''re using our media. They''re using our zoning laws. As I''ve said from day one since I''ve been behind this microphone, our enemy uses our liberty to destroy our liberty. That''s what they''re doing. Wait till you hear about WY, Texas, and what took place there and is taking place there. Texas for God''s sakes. I''ll be right back.

Now broadcasting from the underground command post deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building. We''ve once again made contact with our leader, Mark Leven. Hello America, Mark Leavvin here. Our number 877381-3811 8773813811. Tommy Robinson is a citizen journalist and author free speech activist over in Britain who was thrown in prison I think about 7 months for speaking. He''s been taking on this Islamist wave in Britain been warning the United States literally for years. for years and he''s come to the United States to warn we the people of the United States. And I want to give him the largest platform he''ll probably have, which is this one. I mentioned WY, Texas. W Y L I E. I assume that''s how it''s pronounced. If not, you know, I''ve never been there. But it''s appalling. It sounds like it''s not in a terribly populated town. Father at a WY independent school district board meeting on February 2nd. Listen to this. Just listen to this. All you parents out there and grandparents, listen to this. Cut four. Go. >> America is a Christian nation. >> Amen. >> Amen. The principal one year ago, the principal on the same day, World Hijab Day, wore that hijab and said she loved it all caps. One year to the day later on World Hijab Day, Sunday, Monday hits, they''re putting our girls in Sharia. They''re passing out Sharia pamphlets, hijabs, Qurans, understanding Islam, understanding Sharia, tweeting Sharia treats half of this room like and these women are not. This is not a Muslim nation. This is a CHRISTIAN NATION. >> That principal knew what she was doing. >> And I am not believing there was one or two people at that front desk. FIRE THE PRINCIPAL. >> YOU tell these you tell the the parents don''t go online to get information. But what do they get online? Marco told the truth. That''s where they got the information. And you did online telling us not to go there. This was dawa. Muslim proilitizing. Dawa. It''s like me as a Christian going into a school and witnessing to these kids. You want me to do that? Let''s go. >> You know, you know what''s uh particularly appalling as I listen to this very righteous man. It''s funny when the secularists, the Marxists, the Democrats talk about separation of church and state. You''ve heard that phrase over over again. the Ten Commandments, which truly is the law, the central, the core law, belief system handed to Moses by God, passed on to the Jewish people, passed on and through the Christian people and so forth. You can''t even have a display of the Ten Commandments in a school. You can''t have silent prayer in a school. All of this has been expuned. from the classroom. And now all these Islamists show up over the last 10 or 15 years and we have principles slipping Qurans or pamphlets on Sharia law into little baggies teaching them about uh World Hijab Day and so forth. Prayers taking place The problem is we''re weak. Not you and me. I''m not talking about we, the American people. Our institutions, our so-called ruling class, whether it''s at the local level with school boards and county commissioners or mayors and councils. They''re weak. Zoning boards, weak, intimidated, or worse, believers. You have the st same at the state level, at the national level, not with Trump, but many congressmen, including Republicans. But the problem is the way our country works, the way our federalist system works. We have many little towns and big cities too. And they have a lot of sovereignty in terms of zoning and teaching. And the Islamist scholars and idologues, they figured that out a long time ago. So they go into these zoning board meetings. They go into these schoolboard meetings. I can tell you in Lowden County, they show up at these schoolboard meetings, I''m told, in moss. Every single time there''s a schoolboard meeting, they''re heavily organized. People get intimidated. They get frightened or in the case of Democrats, that''s their new constituency and they need those votes. And nobody wants to be called an Islamophobe, you know, totally madeup term. And yet, if you truly follow Sharia law, you must destroy the Constitution. That''s my point. You must destroy the declaration. You must destroy individual liberty and free will. You must destroy all these things because that supplants Sharia, our law, local, state, federal, constitutional. It supplants it. The ruling class is weak. And by that I mean look at the look at these school boards and look at the teachers unions. The teachers u',NULL,'2026-02-25T06:20:32.811282+00:00',0);

Welcome to the Megan Kelly show. We have major developments today in the Nancy Guthrie case. A new Instagram message from Savannah this morning upping the reward to $1 million and new reporting about those nest images. And we''ll tell you what we saw in the uh in the message from Savannah that revealed new information about this case. But first, President Trump''s State of the Union is tonight, technically his first of the second term. We will have full coverage in AM update and on tomorrow''s Megan Kelly show. The guys from Real Clear Politics will be here to help us break down everything that happens. My prediction, um, the Democrats will make fools of themselves not standing for things that they should. Trump will attack the Supreme Court justices who are there. Um, some Democrats will pull some stupid stunt that we will mock and it will be a great moment when they show the men''s hockey players there. Those are my predictions going in. As for substance, Trump of course will tell everybody how great everything is. The question on my mind is, will he throw in a line of we know people are still hurting, like we know it''s not going fast enough. Will there be any sort of acknowledgment that the American people are still suffering because his poll numbers, as we discussed in AM update today, are reflecting a deep dissatisfaction with the economy, especially among independents, and there''s just no way around it. So, does he acknowledge it or does he do the the typical Trumpian, it''s all good and it''s only getting better, right? Like, it''s very unlike him to sort of say, I know you''re still hurting. So, if I have to put money down on it, I''m going to say he''s not going to say that. Okay. So, uh we will have full coverage again, as I said, tomorrow. Right now, we''re still waiting for the full list of special guests. Usually get that right before the event. We know that the men''s team is on their way to DC and it''s like the controversy that''s been developing around them over the past 24 hours is just absolutely disgusting. I mean, I I we''re going to talk about it, of course, but I think we need to start this hour by saying, remember that normal Americans are not feeling anything like the sound bites we''re going to play for you on today''s show. The political left is crazy, but they will not be able to change Americans opinions about these young men. Try as they and their media enablers might. I mean, people really have lost their minds. Thankfully, golden goalc scoring Jack Hughes and his mom Ellen are out there bringing some rational thoughts. And joining me now with some of his own, Andrew Claven.

It''s good to see you. There''s a lot to go over. Okay. So, let''s just start with some of the leftist reaction because what they''re claiming they''re mad about is that during Trump''s phone call with the boys um from the locker room, he made a joke. And in the joke, he said, you know, he said, "I want you to come to the White House." Cash Patel clearly called the president on his phone because it''s Cash holding his phone. You can see he''s got him programmed in as DT. I I would like to speak to the FBI director about his code. Um and uh Trump''s talking to the guys saying all the fun things and congratulating them. And then he says uh you know come to the White House or come to the State of the Union and he said you know um we''re going to have to invite the women''s team as well or I''ll be impeached. We have it here. >> What would really be cool and we''ll do the White House the next day. We''ll just have some fun. We have medals for you guys. And we have to I must tell you, we''re going to have to bring the woman''s team. You do know that. >> I do believe I probably would be impeached. Okay. >> So, first of all, all the young men, you could hear them chanting two for two. Two for two. Meaning, yes, do it because the women won gold, too. and um lots of screams of yeah, like bring them. Uh but somehow the left would like to parlay this into a controversy about misogynistic young men. And even Trump''s comment as misogynistic as opposed to a joke, an obvious joke. Um and even if it wasn''t a joke, like do we have to pretend that there''s equal interest in men''s sports versus women women''s? I mean, like there if men held a beauty pageant contestant, nobody would watch, right? or fewer would watch them would watch the women. There are a lot of things that women can do. Women in the reality shows are fun. They''re colorful. They''re emotional. They''re interesting to watch. I don''t think like a bunch of guys would be able to carry a reality show in that way because they''re more stoic. They don''t talk about themselves as much. You know, this the old joke like a guy gets a divorce and his the husband of a different wife goes out in the golf course with him for 10 hours. He comes home and the wife is like, "What did he say about the divorce?" And nothing I didn''t ask him. What do you mean? Michelle Obama actually told that exact story about Barack, but it''s a it''s like a meme. Anyway, the point is there are lots of things that make women fascinating and and interesting and people want to tune into them depending on what they''re doing. Sports is one of them. But to pretend that it''s as compelling in the eyes of the American people as men''s sports, men who have the just the prowess that comes with being a larger sized species and the testosterone and all the stuff. What? This is ridiculous how we have to pretend it''s perfectly equal and there''s just as much interest in them women. Okay, I don''t think there is. But in any in any event, Trump was making a joke. Okay, but I''m going to show you a little of the leftist meltdown over the fact that Trump did that. The guys didn''t hang up on him and then they agreed to go to the State of the Union sat nine. I had no idea that the US men''s hockey team warmed up by licking boots. >> That when the men''s US hockey team issues their official apology, I hope that nobody forgives them. They no longer had to treat the women as equals. They were allowed to let their true emotions out legitimately to the US men''s hockey team. you. The women won gold before you did. To watch that, knowing everything that''s going on was sick, nauseiating. >> US men''s hockey team who decided to giggle with the United States president. Just so you know, that''s a very weird way to say that you all have small pee peas. >> It only took you like 37 seconds from getting off of the ice from your game into the locker room to disappoint the entire goddamn country. You loser >> Do not trust her. Well, that was a fun 10 minutes of patriotism. United States, I hate you more and more every day. Donald Trump, I hate you. Hughes Brothers, that was embarrassing. And I hope your mother hates you. >> Andrew, help help us out here. >> Well, well, first of all, this this is a problem, an actual problem in the country is that we''re now dealing with two parties. We we''re a two-party system. One of our parties is are the Republicans who range from the incompetent uh to the somewhat interesting. The other side are the Democrats who are now powered by forces that don''t want this country to exist, that think this it''s bad that this country exists, that thinks that any show of patriotism, uh, is is some kind of, um, you know, fascist idea being expressed, that wants all of our monuments, whether it''s George Washington''s home in Mount Vernon or Thomas Jefferson''s home, they want them all dedicated to the institution of slavery instead of to the people that people go there to see. This is this is an actual attitude that''s at the heart of the Democrat party, though not all Democrats. I mean, there are plenty of patriotic, decent Democrats who just don''t know what they''re voting for anymore. And so, everything gets politicized at a level that is completely inappropriate. First of all, if you''re going to tell me that men get in go into a locker room and make jokes about women, I''m just shocked. I am just shocked. The fact that I can still sit in this chair after hearing this news is incredible. And I actually have have heard though I I shudder to believe it that women when they get together discuss men and even roll their eyes at some of the things that men do. This is part of life that actually I find kind of delightful uh and uh at the heart of all joy and creativity in life. But no, it''s apparently a a terrible terrible thing. So all of this stuff, I mean, when when Alyssa uh Lou, this skater did that incredible incredible routine and won and was uh attacked for having some kind of woke ideas. I didn''t hear the right actually pick up on that at all. You know, that they they thought like, "Yeah, it''s great. We won our America won the gold medal in skating with a fantastic routine." But the left was mocking us because they knew that if she had expressed proTrump ideas, there would have been death threats against her and she would have been uh absolutely uh you know rejected by the left. So we''re really dealing with two different ways of seeing the country. This is different than what was happening before. It used to be let''s say 40 years ago it used to be that the two parties were on either side as as Barack Obama once said of the 50ard line. One thought the government should do a little more, one thought the government should do a little less. But we all thought that this was a great place to be. We all honored our founders. We all honored our founding. That is is over now. And until people start to understand that that''s the argument we''re in, that we''re not in an argument, for instance, about whether illegal immigrants should be deported or not. We''re in an argument whether the country should exist, whether there is in fact no there are no illegals on stolen land, which means this country should not exist, is is an actual non- entity morally. So everything is about that conversation and and what we are always in the uh in the position of doing is playing backup. We''re always being attacked and then having to answer the attacks. We''re playing defense all the time instead of saying no, you know, we love this country. The Huffington Post attacked people for waving flags after the mail hockey victory. I''m not hearing anything about that. You know, they we weren''t supposed to express patriotism in this terrible time of crisis when Donald Trump is president. And I, you know, unlike you, uh, Megan, I can''t use I can''t use the language you use because I''m in the presence of a lady and you''re not. I just, my answer, my response to that is two words long. And the second one is you. I don''t I don''t understand why I can''t wave my flag for this country, which is an amazing country, a beautiful country, a great country. I don''t even have to add it''s not a perfect country because nothing in life is perfect. But but I just I just feel that this division is one we haven''t cottoned on to yet. And the media, which largely sides with the left, works hard not to cotton onto it. We''re not discussing what this great country should do, whether it should go forward a little to the left or a little to the right. We''re discussing whether this country should exist and be celebrated. And if you don''t think that''s true, you only have to look at the nations of Europe, uh, Britain, Germany, where waving flags is basically gone completely out of fashion. And because of that, they''re losing their identities altogether. So, >> well, I''ll tell you something else about about what''s happening here. I I think the vast majority of these women, and there are men, too, will play them. They''re not they''re not actually offended at all by the fact that these guys reacted the way they did to the Trump call. They do hate Trump. Um, but they''re not offended by the way the guys reacted at all. They were offended at them. Period. They are incapable of celebrating a great moment brought to us by white young men. They they are inc they >> hate them. They feel that they are the source of all of society''s problems and ills. And there is something stomach turning for them at watching the nation rally behind men like that. That there aren''t enough men of color. There are no non-binaries on the team. There um are no women on this particular team even though they have their their own their own team. They''re unapologetically patriotic as is apparently in the culture of USA hockey, especially men''s hockey. And all of that was offensive to these people before they saw that phone call, before the guys said they would go to the State of the Union. They were looking for a reason to hate them, to declare their hatred for them. And these guys did not give it to them. I mean, like, listen, let''s just listen to the President Trump phone call one more time. Listen to their reaction. They''re enthusiastic. As soon as he mentions the women, they''re like, "Yeah, they love the women''s team. They they trained with the women''s team. They''ve talked about it. We''ll play some, but just play the Trump bite one more time. >> What would really be cool, and we''ll do the White House the next day. We''ll just have some fun. We have medals for you guys and we have to I must tell you we''re going to have to bring the woman''s team. You do know that. >> I do believe I probably would be impeached. Okay. >> Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Two for two. Two for two. What? Like virtually every guy there was in favor of it, Andrew. But the these leftists need they need to hate these guys. >> You have you ever heard I again it just doesn''t go both ways. We are dealing with two entirely different attitudes toward the country. Have you ever heard Republicans get upset if a basketball team won by saying like, "Oh, there are too many black people on this team." Of of course not. We understand that different, you know, sports attract different kinds of people and there are different a million kinds of people in this country and they''re all Americans if they support America. I think that this is just part of a a a mindset. It''s like they''re high on their own supply. They''ve been selling division, selling racial hatred, selling identity hatred all this time. And now they''ve caught it. Now they''ve caught, you know, they started out, we all started out saying, "Hey, you know, racism is wrong. We got to stop treating black people badly according to their race. We all were kind of moving in that direction, but the left, no, no, it''s not the racism that''s wrong. We were just racist against the wrong people. Now we''re racist against white people." And it''s fine. Now it''s fine. They sit around and talk about women. They don''t even believe women exist. They do not even believe women exist. Not one of them can define a woman. So what are they talking about when they''re against that when they when we say you know the men''s sports and women''s sports are different? That that is just a truth. I mean it is just a truth that men''s sports with the exception of tennis which is an important exception but with the exception of tennis that men''s sports attract more people because men are more into sports and the men''s men are of a higher excellence than the women are. You know, it''s just the way it is. It''s like what? Why are we uh prosecuting reality? We''re prosecuting reality because in reality, people are unequal. In reality, freedom is good. In reality, America is good. And so, we''re attacking all those things because we''re hoping to create this utopian idea that has just infected the minds of so many people. It is just uh it''s dangerous. >> But it''s so it''s so annoying because they try. I mean, you you really have to try to not let let them rain on your parade, but they try. >> You know, I''m thinking about let''s take the news business or let''s take the acting business. Um there there''s no sexism in terms of the audience and their ability to appreciate a male or female news anchor or podcaster for that matter. None. There is there is it is a pure meritocracy. I can speak to that having been at the top of both industries. Um, when I was at Fox, my show was number one and we crushed all competition across the demo and we even wound up beating Bill O''Reilly, who had been the long-term ratings leader for years in that key advertising demo. Uh, you know, a female. So, it was nobody cared. In in, you know, Hollywood, too, there''s male there''s the male Oscar, there''s the female Oscar, but there are mega female stars just like there are mega male stars. you know, you don''t get much bigger than a Julia Roberts, uh, back in her day especially, but now, you know, there''s a lot of other ones that we could name. So, there are many industries where there''s total parody amongst men and women. Now, women have an USA hockey team and they went to the Olympics and won gold and they were celebrated universally. Women have a soccer team which is actually quite popular. Soccer is very po female soccer is very, very popular, including the women''s team, notwithstanding people like Megan Rapino who have tried to absolutely ruin it. Um, but it it is sports in general is generally going to favor the men and viewers generally prefer watching men play sports for the reasons I stated at the top. male prowess, male athleticism, the male figure, the male muscular and muscularkeeletal system, you know, male testosterone, male reaction speed, male aggression, all the things that have made men men for thousands of years translate very well into athletics, and they''re fun to watch in that way. They are more aggressive. They''re they''re more aggressive in virtually every single way. So, it''s like it''s just absurd that we we have to re resort to sexism if there''s not an equal amount of interest in what the women are. Just stop. Okay. There isn''t even Sorry. There''s even a brain. >> But it doesn''t make us sexist. >> Yeah. There''s even a brain element to this in that when when men This is true of all brains that when you watch somebody doing something, uh, your brain sparks as if you were doing it. So if you watch a a man throw a a football pass, there''s something in your brain that actually sparks that''s similar to what''s going on in his brain. That happens more in men more intensely in men. So they''re kind of programmed to like sports, watching sports more than women are because they experience it uh more deeply, which is just not true. If you''re for instance a news anchor or an actress or something like that, then there''s no difference. And so all of these things, you know, all of these things are part of the joy of life. You know the old French f uh phrase viva def France right you know this is these are parts of the things that most of us have been enjoying and they''re exasperating and they''re troublesome and they are just part of you know what it means to be a human being and all of this has to be erased to in order to fulfill the utopian dreams of the left and and you know it''s just what really is a shame is this thing where we have to play defense. So, as you say, they rain on your parade and we have to say, "Don''t rain on our parade," which immediately brings the argument that they''re trying to make into the center. I wish we could simply ignore them. >> Oh, wait. So, can I show you something on this? So, these poor boys now are getting asked about this controversy, which is a non-controversy at every turn. Instead of these reporters just celebrating them and being like, "Congrats, we''re so proud of you." Now, it''s got to turn into, "Oh, the controversy. What about the controversy?" And um I''ll give you an example. This this uh well this is not the today''s show is I don''t mean that the these guys are for ask asking it but we have seen some of these reporters sticking the mic in the guy''s faces but the today''s show had an interview with Jack Hughes our golden gor goal scorer and uh you know the guy without the teeth now he''s great and listen to what he said he handled himself very well but of course it keeps coming up anyway here sat 6B >> I wish there if there was a camera on me and Quinn when the women''s team won. We looked like the biggest Super fans of all time. We were just jumping up and down. We couldn''t believe it. Then we locked in, said goodbye to everyone cuz we had a game the next night. It was it was late and we sprinted out of there. But I remember I saw Megan in the calf. Uh I think it was the night we beat Slovakia. It was the night after they won the gold medal and we were just waiting for food and we were talking and I was just like, "Megan, I''m so proud of you. I''m so happy for you." You know, couldn''t have happened to a better person. And obviously, you know, when mine went in, I just like so many things thoughts and you know, one of my first thoughts was her and I''m just like so proud to join her as a gold medalist and >> sexist disgusting pig. >> Yes. And and interestingly, most competitors in America, although the Canadians were a little bit bitter about their loss, most uh competitors in America do have that strain of sportsmanship, which is what sports is all about. I mean, you do see the, you know, I''m a big NFL fan. You watch these guys beat the living hell out of one another, and then they shake hands and hug each other and congratulate each other on the victory, which is a very difficult, painful thing to do. And yet, they do it. And this is this is all through sports. is only in left-wing politics where this suddenly disappears. You know, I mean, even even I''m I''m old enough to remember when we all sort of thought, well, you know, the people voted for the other guy, so we''re going to have to go with that. I mean, I remember saying that when Obama was elected, even knowing he was going to be a disaster, thinking, well, he he got elected, he got fairly elected, uh, so we have to go with the will of the people. That that ethos has just completely disappeared from some sections of the right, but from all sections of the left. The left has basically convinced themselves that there are two opinions. There''s their opinion and then there''s Hitler. You know, there''s their ideas and then there''s hatefulness. And when you do that, you know, you never have to change your mind. You never have to listen to an argument. You never have to confront somebody with politeness and kindness and respect and say, "All right, let''s hear your ideas and let''s see how my ideas compare." Every time they do that, they lose. Every time they debate, they lose because the things that they''re putting forward. That''s why they don''t want to. So, yeah. So, they can''t debate anymore. So, they can''t talk anymore. the only thing they can do, you know, you''re talking about the State of the Union. They''re planning a people''s state of the union somewhere else because they can''t because they can''t behave themselves in a respectful way during Trump''s State of the Union. They have to leave the room. They''re like children who have to be put into a >> They''re literally going to be outside with people in inflatable frog costumes that skip that skip around. Okay, wait. I want to show you another couple things. Uh, one more from Jack Hughes. Here''s he''s he''s speaking to the Daily Mail buted to Jack Hughes''s mama who herself is a badass. Ellen Hughes is not only a star hockey player in her own right who married a star hockey player and they produced three star hockey players. Literally all three boys are in the NHL. Um but Ellen has been an advisor um and a consultant to the women''s gold medal winning team. Uh so she is she''s got a foot in both camps on this one. So listen to Jack. Some of this is on the politics and and Ellen too on the Today show speaking to the Trump comments. >> That''s true. >> Are you guys excited to be going to the White House and meeting Trump? >> Yeah, we''re excited. I mean, anytime like everything is so political. We''re just we''re athletes. We''re so proud to represent the US and you get the chance to go to the White House, meet the president. You know, we''re proud to be Americans and, you know, that''s so patriotic. So, >> no matter what your views are, we''re we''re super excited to go >> to the White House tomorrow and just be a part of that. >> You''re cheering on both teams. How did that comment land for you? >> Well, I think at the end of the day, it''s just about the country and the moment that these players, both the men and women, can bring so much unity to a group and to a country. People that cheered on that don''t watch hockey, people that have politics on one side or on the other side. And that''s all both the men''s team and the women''s team care about. If you could see what we see from the inside and the men and women sharing, you know, dorms, dorm rooms and halls and flex floors and the camaraderie and the synergy and the way the women cheered on the men and the way the men cheer it on the women. That''s what it''s all about. And the other things they cannot control. Um, they care about humanity. They care about unity. And they care about the country. nailed it. >> That must have that must have made the interviewers very upset. You know, they''re like they''re like villains. They''re like villains in a cartoon. No, unity. We don''t want that. You know, it''s like it''s embarrassing. >> What did you make of the president''s comment? You hated it, didn''t you? The implication clearly is. >> Yeah. Yeah. And it''s just it is a shame. It it is kind of comical. I I just I just wish we had enough media territory. We''re winning some media territory and we''ve certainly changed the game a lot because of shows like yours and the Daily Wire and all these other places, but it''s still not enough. They can still push this agenda into the world. I mean, I wonder, you know, I keep seeing these polls, and I believe the polls, I think the polls are true, that people are unhappy, feel that they''re worse off than they were a year ago, and that''s going to be a an impediment to Trump''s State of the Union message. But I kind of wonder what they''re seeing. What What is it? is are are their economics worse than they were a year ago and it''s just taking a while for the general rise in the economy to catch up with them or is it just the news is so full of panic and hatred and uh and division that that''s infecting the way they think? I don''t know the answer to that question. I''m surprised that people feel that they''re worse off than they were under Biden. I mean, the worst president of my lifetime, which goes back to the Civil War, you know, and I I don''t I I don''t know what they''re saying, but I wonder if it''s this kind of this media infusion of division and hatred. It may well be, but I don''t know. >> I I''m looking for this tweet because it was very funny to me. Um, yeah, here it is. So, somebody named Liz tweets out the following. It''s got 1.2 2 million views already with 56,000 likes uh likes. Thinking about the hockey moms that spent over a decade of their lives driving their sons to and from hockey practice and games just for their sons to grow up to become Olympic gold medalists who laugh at misogynistic jokes at the expense of women. And then you''ve got like this response from Jill who I reposted. Hockey mom saw a team of hardworking, dedicated young men. Hockey moms are proud of how this team represented their country. Hockey moms saw that these men are a family and will never forget those that they have lost. Hockey moms saw the joy in their own son''s eyes when they watched this team win gold on Sunday. Us hockey moms don''t have time for your That''s that seems to encapsulate the true hockey mom and American attitude. >> Absolutely. And if these people care so much about women''s sports, how come they let men play them? You know, how come they''re so they''re so eager to have men, you know, dressed up as women beat the living crap out of out of actual women in a boxing ring? You know, why why is that okay? Why is it okay to stick these men male swimmers into swimming pools? I''ve seen how girls work hard to become great swimmers and they put a man in there who''s just who pretends he''s a woman and and he beats he beats their speed. I mean, why is that okay? I don''t understand why suddenly suddenly their dear hearts tremble for these poor women who they were ready to erase yesterday. I mean the day before the Olympics they were ready to erase these women completely off the face of the earth. They didn''t exist. They couldn''t define what a woman was so that a man had to be able to play with them. I I don''t understand the sentiment. >> This brings me to a guy named Ian Kennedy. Okay.

All that and more coming up in just a moment on your AM update. Our sponsor, the Electronic Payments Coalition, says Washington politicians are always getting in your wallet, and now they''re messing with your credit card. They say your credit card and the security it offers are under attack, and that senators Dick Durban and Roger Marshall want to change the nation''s payment system to benefit corporate mega stores like Walmart and Target at the expense of everyday Americans. Credit cards can keep your payments secure and provide rewards that families use to help make everyday purchases more affordable. The Electronic Payments Coalition says the Durban Marshall mandates would let corporate mega stores cut corners on credit card processing, routing transactions over cheaper, untested networks with weaker security and fewer protections.

According to a new CNN poll released yesterday, just 36% of respondents say they approve of the way Mr. Trump is handling his job as president. 63% disapprove. This marking a steep drop from last year''s leadup to Mr. Trump''s joint address to Congress. His approval rating then after just a few weeks in office at 48% in a CNN poll. Asked about the direction of the country, just 38% of surveyed adults this week say Mr. Trump''s policies are moving the US in the right direction. 61% say we''re headed in the wrong one. As the president prepares to address the nation tonight, 57% of respondents say the economy and cost of living is the top issue they want him to address. Trailing way behind in second place, immigration at just 13%. The state of US democracy at 11%, healthc care at 7, crime and safety and foreign policy all lagging far behind. CNN chief data analyst Harry Entin says the biggest driver of the slide is the president''s collapse with independence. >> What is driving this drop? I said record was the name of the game when it came to this segment, right? Talking about the lowest Trump has ever been going into the state of the union. the lowest that any president has been this century going into a state of the union at this point in their presidency. It is also the weakest that Donald Trump has ever been with independence at this point. A year ago, Donald Trump was atus 13 points. Look at this. Minus 47 points among independents. The lowest Donald Trump has ever been in either of his two terms as president with independence. That is driving these numbers. Meanwhile, the president not faring much better in new polling done jointly by the Washington Post and ABC News. That survey showing 39% approval versus 60% disapproval. Mr. Trump''s highest disapproval rating since the days after the January 6th capital riot. Breaking it down by issue, just 41% say they approve of the president''s handling of the economy. 57% disapprove. On immigration, 40% approve versus 58% who disapprove. On tariffs, 34% approve versus 64% who do not. While the numbers for President Trump look rough, Democrats in Congress hardly benefiting. On immigration in the news these past couple of months with non-stop negative coverage for the president, 38% of registered voters say they trust President Trump more. 34% prefer Democrats on this issue with 24% saying neither. On reducing the cost of living, it''s essentially a tie. 32% trust President Trump more. 31% prefer Democrats. 33% say they trust neither. As President Trump makes the case tonight for his administration, some Democrats preparing to boycott the event altogether. US Senator from California, Adam Schiff, announcing in a Saturday social media video that he will not be in attendance. >> I will not be attending the State of the Union. I''ve never missed one. I have always gone both to inaugurations and to states of the union, but we cannot treat this as normal. This is not business as usual. I will not give him the audience he craves for the lies that he tells. >> Okay, Mr. Schiff instead will participate in an alternate event outside of the capital building hosted by left-wing groups Midas Touch and move on.org. Several other Democrat lawmakers also planning to skip the State of the Union, including Senators Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Ed Marky of Massachusetts, Chris Van Holland of Maryland, and Congresswoman Primila Gyipal of Washington. Set to deliver the Democrat response to the president''s remarks, newly elected Virginia Governor Abigail Spamberger. You know, the one who stood silent for what felt like forever when asked in her gubanatorial debate about boys and girls locker rooms and also when her attorney general who wanted Republicans and their children murdered. Not a peep back then. Now she''s feeling chatty. President Trump''s full list of special guests not yet announced. The goldinning US men''s hockey team is expected. The gold-winning women''s team is not. a US hockey spokesperson telling NBC the women are unable to attend quote due to the timing and previously scheduled academic and professional commitments. The ladies adding they were honored to be included and are grateful for the acknowledgement. House Speaker Mike Johnson telling reporters yesterday that House officials are scrambling to find a place for the beloved men''s team following their lastminute invite from President Trump moments after they beat Canada in Milan. The remarks set to begin at 9:00 p.m. Eastern. President Trump declaring yesterday National Angel Family Day. The White House event attended by dozens of family members whose loved ones have been killed by illegal immigrants. Mr. Trump maintaining a long-standing bond with angel families, dating back to his first administration, frequently meeting privately with families at the White House and highlighting their stories as the administration pushes for tougher immigration enforcement and mass deportations. Here, the president welcoming the families and accusing the establishment media and the left of totally ignoring their stories. >> These are the angel families that we love that for decades our government betrayed and our media totally ignored and I''ve seen it. When I first got involved with the angel families, I had a meeting was so sad and they got up and spoke and the media literally just turned off the cameras. They didn''t want to hear them. It was the most It was my first glimpse as to what was happening. These are sick people, an infinite loss. They were the victims of politicians who put the comfort of foreign criminals before the safety of American citizens and American patriots. Their stories were censored and suppressed like maybe almost never before so that the politicians could open our borders and allow our nation to be invaded. If we didn''t win the election, our nation would right now be destroyed. President Trump choosing to sign the proclamation on February 22nd in honor of Lake and Riley, the 22-year-old Augusta University nursing student murdered on that date two years ago during a morning jog by illegal immigrant Joseé Ibara. Ibara had multiple run-ins with the law, released each time before eventually going on to murder Leaken. Her death along with similar cases emerging as a central issue in the 2024 campaign leading to the first piece of legislation signed under the second Trump administration, the Lake and Riley Act, requiring the Department of Homeland Security to detain illegal immigrants arrested for certain violent crimes. Leaken''s mother, Allison Phillips, invited to speak yesterday. If you''ve lived the nightmare that we have lived, you understand the importance of the job that he''s doing and securing our nation and fighting for our families because this could be any family. She wasn''t somebody that put herself in bad positions. She didn''t make bad choices. She was just a good girl and she just wanted to go for a run that morning. I''m beyond blessed and thankful that you''re honoring not just Leaken because she''s one and a ton of people that have suffered at the hands of illegal immigrants. She''s not the only one. And so, thank you for honoring all of them, not just Lake. Coming up, a federal judge slamming former special counsel Jack Smith in an order blocking the release of his report on President Trump''s classified documents case.

In a major victory for President Trump, US District Judge Ailen Cannon blocking the release of former special counsel Jack Smith''s report detailing his prosecution of Mr. Trump over the handling of classified documents at Mara Lago. President Trump and his co-fendants Walt Natada and Carlos D. Aloe vera first moving to block the report''s release back in January 2025 upon learning of its creation. On Monday, Judge Cannon, a Trump appointee, prohibiting the DOJ from quote, "releasing, distributing, conveying, or sharing with anyone outside the Department of Justice any information or conclusions in the report or in drafts thereof." In July 2024, Judge Cannon of the Southern District of Florida, tossing out Smith''s case against Mr. Trump and two codefendants finding Smith was improperly appointed. Judge Cannon''s 15-page ruling yesterday slamming Smith for after his disqualification, compiling and delivering the report to Attorney General Merrick Garland after the case was thrown out, accusing Smith of circumventing the court''s order. Judge Cannon writing the release of this report would quote cause irreparable damage to the former defendants by disclosing non-public discovery materials, adding it would violate quote basic notions of fairness and justice in the process where no adjudication of guilt has been reached. Judge Cannon writing that while in cases where a defendant pleads guilty or where the prosecutor elects not to bring charges, sometimes a special counsel will release a final report, it is quote, "Certainly not customary for a prosecutor to disseminate large swaths of discovery after a case is dismissed without finding the defendant guilty and where the defendants still maintain their innocence." Smith submitting the report to Attorney General Merrick Garland before vacating his post in January 2025. Volume one of the report was focused on Smith''s investigation into alleged attempts by Mr. Trump to overturn the 2020 election. Smith managed to spring that one on the public days before President Trump''s inauguration. Volume two focuses more on the classified documents case. On that, Judge Cannon telling Smith, "Nice try, but no cigar. Opening statements yesterday in the trial of Utah mother Corey Richens accused of fatally poisoning her husband Eric in March 2022. Summit County prosecutors charging the 35-year-old more than a year later with aggravated murder attempted aggravated murder, mortgage fraud, and forgery, alleging she spiked her husband''s Moscow mule cocktail with nearly five times a lethal dose of fentanyl at their home near Park City. The state alleging Cory killed her husband to gain access to his business assets and life insurance payouts. Money prosecutors say she intended to use to save her indebted real estate business. The case drawing national attention when authorities arrested Richens just weeks after she published a children''s book she wrote, which she says she wrote to help her three young sons cope with their grief after the loss of their father. Cory held in custody since her arrest, denying bail multiple times. In court yesterday during opening statements, prosecutor Brad Bworth telling jurors Corey was involved in a relationship with another man, Robert Josh Gman. Bworth showing the jury text messages between the two. Cory fantasizing about leaving her husband, gaining millions in the divorce, and then marrying Grossman. Court documents indicating Cory took out multiple life insurance policies, totaling about $2 million on her husband without his knowledge. According to Bworth, Corey was allegedly $4.5 million in debt and wrongly believed she would inherit $4 million upon her husband''s passing. Bworth laying out the timeline on the night of Eric''s death, >> March the 3rd, 2022. The defendant, Corey Richens, her husband, Eric Richens, and their three children, nine-year-old Carter, 7-year-old Ashton, and 5-year-old Weston, are at their home in Camas. Eric Richens live for his three boys. At 7:22 PM, Corey Richen''s boyfriend, Robert Josh Gman, texts Corey Richens an image of two people romantically kissing. The image is captioned, "Love you." At 8:36, Cory Richens replies, "Love you." The boys go to bed. Corey Richens makes Eric a drink and takes it to him in their bedroom. He drinks on the bed. She departs the bedroom. Corey Richens returns to the bedroom at about 3:00 a.m. She feels that Eric is cold. She nudges him. He does not respond. >> Defense attorney Katherine Nester beginning her argument with 911 audio from that night. >> I just emergency. I''m not breathing. She''s cold. >> Can you do CPR? >> No. I don''t know. You don''t know. I''m going to tell you how to. Are you willing to do CPR? >> Yeah. >> Those were the sounds of a wife becoming a widow. >> Nester pointing to a key unanswered question in the case. >> He ingested a fatal dose of fentinel. What you will never hear after 4 years of investigation where as recently as two weeks ago they were back searching that house. After 4 years of investigation and 5 weeks of this trial, you know what you''re never going to hear is how that fendel got inside of him because there is zero evidence of that. To this day, slide 11, please. You''re going to see that his death certificate reads, "But the manner of his death is still unknown to this day." You''re going to hear testimony that a medical examiner has the ability to declare the manner of someone''s death. It can be homicide. It can be suicide. It can be accidental overdose. It can be um murder. It can be anything. To this day, the medical examiner, the professional that''s the head of declaring how people die in the state of Utah, has never been able to determine the manner of Eric Rich''s death. Nester telling jurors that Eric was dependent on drugs like marijuana gummies to relieve pain, pointing to a crime scene photo showing an empty expired hydrocodone bottle in the couple''s bedroom. Nester also happens to be the attorney for Tyler Robinson, the accused killer of Charlie Kirk. Prosecutors calling Eric''s sister, Katie Richensbson, to the stand the first day of the trial. Benson describing what she believed to be unusual behavior from her sister-in-law on the night of Eric''s death. >> Who was there when you arrived? >> Sorry, guys. This was the worst day of my life. I''m sorry. When I got there, there was a bunch of emergency personnel, police officers, and Corey and her mom, Lisa, were there. And I saw Corey standing on the other side of the staircase. She just shook her head at me. I observed that she was she was not how she normally was when we would go on overnights. She was very well put together. She had a matching pajamaesque outfit on. Her hair was all done up. She wasn''t crying like I was. She wasn''t hysterical. Just stood there and shook her head no at me. On cross Benson admitting that her brother had previously been prescribed hydrocodone, had used THC, and drank alcohol socially. If convicted, Richens could face a maximum of life in prison. She has pleaded not guilty on all counts. MK True Crime will be live streaming every second of this trial at their YouTube channel with coverage from all of our top legal experts. The trial is expected to last through late March. And that''ll do it for your AM update. I''m Megan Kelly.

Sheriff Nanos won''t tell us, but she got some details. I don''t know if this is the entirety of of the DN the DNA, but she did get some more details on what was found inside of that house. Here it is in SAT 54. Today, another law enforcement source familiar with the investigation >> has said that >> the pattern of that blood inside the house matches the pattern outside the house outside NY''s front doors. Uh those pattern droplets, as many um experts uh have, you know, describe it are as vertical. They''re they''re they''re they fall straight up and down 90°. Um and there''s no smears. There''s no stepping in it. There''s no struggle. there''s no signs of struggle on that front doorstep. My source tells me it is exactly the same inside the house that there''s no sign of struggle in that blood. It''s not smeared. There''s no steps. Um they are those straight up and down drop pattern blood. I asked where in the house and I did not get that answer. I can''t tell you if it was in the bedroom, if it was in the front entrance. >> So that''s a pretty good clue as to what went down that night potentially. Will >> Yeah, I think so. I mean to cover your first point, Megan, which was about the search and rescue and the sheriff calling it off very quickly, I I am more inclined to although statistically, yes, the chances of recovering someone within a designated period of time, it diminishes beyond that time, but until such time as unless he had specific evidence to support the reasoning for calling off that search and rescue, I think the search and rescue should continue. uh whether it be using drones, whether it be using aerial capabilities, whether it be soliciting neighbors, all sorts of things. This this can go on for an awfully long time. And determining also what NY''s typical pattern of life was. You know, what was her routine? Where did she go? Was there a local coffee shop that she would regularly frequent? Until such time as all those inquiries had been exhausted, I don''t think you can call off a search and rescue. And I''ve had individuals where communications with with um um kidnappers has broken down and you''ll you''ll actually send out a missing person''s initiative. So again, it falls again into this bundle of errors that the sheriff seems to be calling, whether it be opening up the crime scene, enabling, you know, treasure hunters to come and start digging around. And I agree with Eric entirely on the point of, you know, if if she was going to be incapacitated and certainly from the drops of blood, it would appear, and I think I can give the credit to Eric on this because we discussed this during the break, that she was probably being carried over the individuals, the perpetrator''s shoulder, which is hence why the drops fell as they did through the property and then out. And I''m sure Eric will probably be able to give you a little bit more on that. He''s probably more of a blood expert than me, but certainly it just seems a catalog of errors um as to the how that the whole site has been managed, the process has been managed and and it smacks horribly of uh a pettiness that the sheriff has towards the the bureau and and uh and his unwillingness to >> on that front. on that front. Now, this is speculative on my part, but >> my understanding is if this is officially a kidnapping from day one, the FBI does have jurisdiction like that they the FBI could have swooped in and said, "We''ll take it." Um, if it''s just an abduction, if it''s if it''s a murder, then it''s a local crime and it''s the sheriff''s. So, I could have that wrong, but I did hear that from a legal expert I trust over the weekend. And that could potent, we know this sheriff, he denies it, but we know from his earlier statements, he can''t stand the FBI. He has a bad history with them. He does not like them. They''ve investigated his department. And it''s possible he was like, "It''s an abduction. It''s not an it''s not a kidnapping. There''s no reason for the FBI." And then eventually, like 72 hours in, he realized, "Oh I''m in over my head." I don''t know. It''s just a possibility. But the the blood pattern inside the house matching the blood pattern outside the house that we''ve seen, Eric, is interesting that with the new detail that she was taken from her bed is starting to give us a visual in how they got her out. So expand on your statement to Will. >> Well, you know what we were talking about earlier is it seems like if it''s a 90°, so you have a straight line, a pattern of blood droplets moving along. Um, now she could have been carried, she could have been dragged and bleeding. You know, there are a couple reasons she could be bleeding. There could have been blunt force trauma. Uh, and then she''s pulled out. She could have been actually killed in the home and it''s an it it''s not an abduction of the person, but a taking away of the body. Uh, or, you know, something could have happened in the home, an altercation, and they decided we need we need to get her out. We need to go. And, um, as she''s being pulled along, she''s bleeding. uh when you''re 84 years old, if you''re grabbed roughly, that skin can tear a lot easier than when you''re much younger. Um and so that could have caused it. Uh but either way, it looks to me uh that she was pulled out um or carried. Uh she she dropped blood in a certain pattern that matches interior of the house, the porch, and of course along the driveway. And then she''s thrown in a car and taken away. And we um we don''t know what happened to her since then. Well, the other thing we don''t know is how much blood is inside, which is why, you know, I''ve wondered all along if this sheriff is leaning toward murder as opposed to abduction, and he''s got to keep abduction open because she''s no longer there, James. But if there''s a lot of blood inside that house, it''s possible the sheriff all along has been, and don''t forget, he called in homicide detectives immediately. It''s possible from the get-go he''s been thinking this is a homicide. >> Yeah. And you''re right. And he also might have told her, you know, or told Savannah she was taken from her bed because that''s where the, you know, a large deposit of the blood was. That would make complete sense if the video we''re now seeing. Um but but why take the body? This case just the more you look at it, the the less and less it makes any sense. You know, why take her body if if if she died, you know, in the bed or right there there was a stroke. >> What if she fought? James. >> Yeah. >> You know, and then she''s got the perpetrator''s DNA under her fingertips. >> Yeah, it''s possible. Again, there had have been a reason. I try not too much to get in the head of these people cuz, you know, you drive yourself crazy. Um but it''s just bizarre. And then I think unless Eric saw it somewhere, I have not seen a lot of blood leaving the porch going down that little um step up, you know, the steps with the rod iron where that blue t-shirt was left. I I I''ve only seen blood Yeah. Like I don''t see any. >> Here''s the Fox News video and and it does show some blood >> on that this little path that we''re looking at right now leading >> into >> the the red bricks. So the blood does continue. That was news that we didn''t know courtesy of Fox. >> Yeah, it''s >> um after they released that video of the intruder. Here''s you can see see a little see blood. >> Okay. >> Drops of blood. This is courtesy of Fox. >> Yeah. And interesting that he didn''t step in it. Interesting. It is very dark. We know how dark it is there. So, how how do we, you know, from an evidentary standpoint, how do we how do we get get there? How was he able to carry her or move her and and that thing''s falling at a 90 without, you know, any real movement, which you would expect carrying someone out and then not step in it at 2 in the morning with it''s so dark there. Maybe he''s using that mouth light that he had, but it''s odd to me. Well, Eric''s theory of her possibly being over his shoulder, like bleeding >> behind him as he walked forward. >> Yeah, >> that would explain. >> Yeah, I like that a lot. And then what? To the car and then we go um >> but but I mean you guys could speak to this more easily than I I think I could speculate to it, but her I think she was um 5 foot five and 150 pounds. Um, if she were no longer living, that would be extremely heavy, >> right, to lift. >> Yes. >> Dead weight. Like a dead weight of 150 lbs weighs even more. It feels like it weighs even more, right? I mean, Eric, you''re >> But we''re also we''re also assuming that there''s only one person that there could be multiple people, and I suspect there there would have been multiple people if they''re carrying her out, right? um you know that''s very difficult for an or it could be one person who kind of uh restrains her you know he had a lot in that backpack you know so he could have had restraints he could have gagged her um she could have been bleed he walked her out um and and forced her into a car so we just don''t know >> we have zero reason to disbelieve that zero reason to disbelieve we haven''t seen it like an empty car sitting there waiting and we didn''t see a the per come up and turn off the ignition with no one else in it like We we there absolutely could have been another person there.

Both hosts emphasize that long speeches lose audiences and argue that Trump&mdash;despite being a natural showman&mdash;would benefit from a tighter, more powerful address that highlights major accomplishments: record‑low violent crime, a secured border, strong GDP growth, lower mortgage rates, and falling inflation.

Clay Travis&rsquo;s declaration that Taylor Swift is the &ldquo;modern‑day Beatles.&rdquo; Clay doubles down on his cultural take, arguing that Taylor Swift&rsquo;s songwriting catalog, longevity, and stadium‑selling power will endure for decades, much like The Beatles, while Buck Sexton strongly disagrees. The debate quickly ignites a flood of listener reaction, with calls, emails, and talkbacks pouring in from across the country. Listeners challenge the comparison, propose alternative analogies&mdash;such as Taylor Swift being more akin to Elvis or Madonna&mdash;and passionately defend or reject Clay&rsquo;s argument.</p> <p>Clay and Buck read and respond to a wide range of listener feedback, turning the controversy into a humorous and highly engaging audience exchange. Clay lists his personal &ldquo;top five&rdquo; Taylor Swift songs and predicts her continued cultural dominance, while Buck counters with broader reflections on music history, nostalgia acts, and the decline of contemporary music compared to earlier decades. The conversation expands to include discussions of boy bands like the Backstreet Boys, legacy acts such as the Rolling Stones, and the enduring appeal of 1990s music, with Buck suggesting that the popularity of nostalgia tours reflects a lack of compelling modern artists.</p> <p>Make sure you never miss a second of the show by subscribing to the Clay Travis &amp; Buck Sexton show podcast wherever you get your podcasts! <a href="http://ihr.fm/3InlkL8">ihr.fm/3InlkL8</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For the latest updates from Clay &amp; Buck, visit our website <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clayandbuck.com%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CMarkWeiner%40iheartmedia.com%7Cf1fb28049c334a2cc7f008dd5b6dc780%7C122a527e5b714eba878d9810b495b9e3%7C0%7C0%7C638767249239931219%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3','https://podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pscrb.fm/rss/p/arttrk.com/p/D5CA5/mgln.ai/e/28/pdst.fm/e/traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/e73c998e-6e60-432f-8610-ae210140c5b1/57c236de-aec0-46c1-b141-ae3c00026d77/c7b3216b-3974-4d45-ab39-b3f7013c0136/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=1776c4cc-50a1-410f-a2de-ae3c00026dfa',NULL,'{"synopsis": "In this Sunday casual episode of The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show, hosts Clay Travis and Buck Sexton engage in an extended pop culture debate over Clay''s claim that Taylor Swift is the ''modern-day Beatles,'' with Buck pushing back strongly.

A former JSOC advance‑force operator attached to an East Coast Naval Special Warfare squadron, he ran advanced cyber warfare and close‑range reconnaissance missions before crossing over into the world of high‑stakes defense technology and enterprise security.\u000a\u000aIn industry, Nik helped build and lead security at three of the most influential defense‑tech companies of the last decade. He served as head of cybersecurity operations at SpaceX and later led international cyber defense programs at Palantir, giving him a front‑row seat to how software, data, and security shape modern national power. He then became CIO and CISO at Anduril Industries, where he built the company’s cybersecurity and weapons‑system security programs from the ground up while Anduril was racing to field autonomous systems for the Pentagon.\u000a\u000aToday, Nik is the founder and CEO of Wraithwatch, a cyber defense company born from his frustration that defenders are almost always forced to react second. At Wraithwatch, he is focused on “weaponizing” AI for defense at scale—using advanced models to help blue teams pre‑empt and out-iterate attackers instead of learning only from breaches and red‑team reports.

He was stabbed twice in the back with a screwdriver. The wound pierced and collapsed his lung. The physical scars healed quickly but the mental ones took a lot longer. For years Dan battled with panic attacks and anxiety. He was plagued with worries that his lung had collapsed again, his father became his chaperone as he was afraid to walk the streets alone.</p><p>Two years later, Dan met his attacker as part of a restorative justice programme, and while he got the apology he needed the panic attacks and fear continued. What helped him was writing about that day. He told the story of the stabbing through poetry and added to it a new narrative, one that painted his attacker in a kinder light. He wanted to humanise him, make him less of a monster and show that there is more than one side to each of us. Dan has gone on to perform this poem hundreds of times and earned himself a huge following for his work as a spoken word artist and musician. He writes primarily for what he calls a lost generation – young adults who grew up in an age of social media, digital natives who are inundated with options, comparisons and aspirations. He also now writes a lot about love. Dan''s poetry collection is called I Don''t Want To Settle. He will be on tour in Europe and the US in November. The presenter is Jo Fidgen.</p><p>Lives Less Ordinary is a podcast from the BBC World Service that brings you the most incredible true stories from around the world. Each episode a guest shares their most dramatic, moving, personal story. Listen for unbelievable twists, mysteries uncovered, and inspiring journeys - spanning the entire human experience.
